MISS ADRENALINE: A TALE OF TWINS

2
00:00:16,015 > 00:00:17,517
DELIVERY ROOM

3
00:00:22,480 > 00:00:24,983
You can do it.
Keep going. Breathe.

4
00:00:25,066 > 00:00:27,986
Don't close your legs. Don't.

5
00:00:29,320 > 00:00:30,321
Come on.

6
00:00:30,405 > 00:00:31,740
Just a bit longer.

7
00:00:36,661 > 00:00:38,747
Come on.
Open up.

8
00:01:08,651 > 00:01:09,778
20 YEARS LATER

9
00:01:09,861 > 00:01:12,072
Hey, Romina,
don't forget you go last here.

10
00:01:12,155 > 00:01:13,823
Oh, you snooze, you lose.

11
00:01:14,783 > 00:01:17,410
Don't you know
female centaurs don't exist?

12
00:01:17,494 > 00:01:21,831
Tato, did you know that if there's a male,
it's because a female gave birth to it?

13
00:01:22,749 > 00:01:25,168
You know what you need
to do to become a centaur?

14
00:01:25,251 > 00:01:27,295
Instead of plodding along, learn to fly.

15
00:01:27,378 > 00:01:30,423
Come on, Tato,
instead of trying to distract me,

16
00:01:30,507 > 00:01:32,133
focus on yourself.

17
00:01:33,468 > 00:01:35,720
Because Ebony and I are all in!

18
00:01:36,346 > 00:01:38,306
Let's see if you can beat this time.

19
00:01:38,389 > 00:01:40,683
Let's see if you can stay on your bike.

20
00:02:47,667 > 00:02:48,710
No!

21
00:02:49,377 > 00:02:52,338
What a fall, let's help.
No, wait.

22
00:02:53,882 > 00:02:56,301
Out of the way!

23
00:02:56,384 > 00:02:58,428
How did nothing happen to that guy?

24
00:02:59,262 > 00:03:01,639
That guy's fierce.
Got up like it was nothing.

25
00:03:01,723 > 00:03:03,349
Go, Romina!

26
00:03:03,433 > 00:03:06,394
Let's go see who wins the race.
Let's go.

27
00:03:28,875 > 00:03:34,714
Romina Páez
is the national downhill champion!

28
00:03:37,759 > 00:03:40,637
Laurita, it's turning out beautifully.

29
00:03:40,720 > 00:03:43,014
If you say so, Rubén.

30
00:03:43,097 > 00:03:44,599
I do.

31
00:03:44,682 > 00:03:48,061
Oh, Rubén, wait. I have a gift for you.

32
00:03:49,604 > 00:03:51,648
Freshly made truffles.

33
00:03:51,731 > 00:03:53,233
Whoa!
Uhuh.

34
00:03:54,108 > 00:03:55,735
How's your blood sugar?

35
00:03:55,818 > 00:03:56,945
Fine.

36
00:03:57,570 > 00:04:00,698
It's fine, 95 on an empty stomach.

37
00:04:01,950 > 00:04:03,326
It is.
I'll see.

38
00:04:03,409 > 00:04:04,827
Yeah. Oui.

39
00:04:04,911 > 00:04:07,372
You're my official taste tester.
Of course.

40
00:04:07,455 > 00:04:08,665
Never forget that.

41
00:04:11,209 > 00:04:12,377
Hi, Diego.

42
00:04:13,169 > 00:04:16,381
Hey, new haircut. It looks great on you.

43
00:04:17,090 > 00:04:19,259
Hi, Moni. How are you?

44
00:04:19,342 > 00:04:21,928
Jorge, it's so nice to see you
around here again.

45
00:04:22,428 > 00:04:25,807
Hi, Luzma.
How are you, miss? Your juice.

46
00:04:26,349 > 00:04:29,227
Could you be any sweeter? Thank you.
You're welcome.

47
00:04:29,978 > 00:04:32,605
I'll be right back.
Okay.

48
00:04:32,689 > 00:04:34,107
What's your name?

49
00:04:34,190 > 00:04:35,942
Romina Páez.

50
00:04:36,025 > 00:04:40,029
What a pleasant surprise
to see a woman win this race.

51
00:04:40,113 > 00:04:41,489
Why?

52
00:04:41,572 > 00:04:45,660
Because I think it's brave to compete
in a high risk sport such as this one.

53
00:04:45,743 > 00:04:47,954
You know what's actually high risk?

54
00:04:48,579 > 00:04:51,791
Living in this neighborhood.
That takes bravery.

55
00:04:52,458 > 00:04:53,668
Why do you say that?

56
00:04:54,294 > 00:04:57,547
Because this neighborhood
is full of moneylenders, loan sharks,

57
00:04:57,630 > 00:05:00,967
and payday lenders.
They're screwing over the neighborhood.

58
00:05:01,050 > 00:05:04,470
And what do the police do?
Just park wherever they want.

59
00:05:04,554 > 00:05:09,225
I wish they'd actually do something
to keep the neighborhood safe, but well,

60
00:05:09,309 > 00:05:10,935
it's kind of complicated.

61
00:05:12,687 > 00:05:14,689
Thanks, Romina. Congrats!

62
00:05:14,772 > 00:05:17,984
What a warm welcome for the police!

63
00:05:18,067 > 00:05:20,278
Buddy, now I want to meet her.

64
00:05:20,361 > 00:05:22,947
On top of being beautiful,
she's brave and tough.

65
00:05:23,031 > 00:05:25,158
It was love at first pedal.

66
00:05:25,241 > 00:05:27,493
You know what I'm curious about?
What?

67
00:05:27,577 > 00:05:29,329
The whole loan shark thing.

68
00:05:29,412 > 00:05:33,583
Congrats, Rominita.
How are you? Did you see me fall?

69
00:05:33,666 > 00:05:38,546
Hey, Rominita! Congratulations!

70
00:05:38,629 > 00:05:41,924
A round of applause
for our national champion!

71
00:05:42,008 > 00:05:46,220
Your national downhill champion,
ladies and gentlemen!

72
00:05:46,304 > 00:05:49,932
The pride of La Mirla!

73
00:05:50,016 > 00:05:52,310
You're beautiful, sweetheart!

74
00:05:52,393 > 00:05:53,603
TOKYO, JAPAN

75
00:05:53,686 > 00:05:54,854
Hi, Dad.

76
00:05:54,937 > 00:05:58,524
Hi, Laura! How are you, sweetheart?
What's new? Tell me everything.

77
00:05:58,608 > 00:05:59,525
Good.

78
00:05:59,609 > 00:06:03,613
Rubén and I went to the bakery
to see how it was coming along.

79
00:06:05,364 > 00:06:08,034
And, to answer your question,
it's turning out lovely.

80
00:06:08,117 > 00:06:10,286
Wait. I'll let you talk to your mom.

81
00:06:10,369 > 00:06:12,789
I'm glad everything is going well.
Hi, darling!

82
00:06:12,872 > 00:06:17,251
I'm so glad to see you. How are you?
What I wouldn't give to squeeze you.

83
00:06:17,335 > 00:06:21,547
Mom, explain to me why Dad calls me
if he never has time to talk?

84
00:06:22,465 > 00:06:25,968
Oh, darling. You know what he's like.
Yeah.

85
00:06:26,052 > 00:06:28,096
Always working.
Yeah.

86
00:06:28,179 > 00:06:33,351
But don't let it bother you, darling.
That's how he shows his love.

87
00:06:33,434 > 00:06:36,813
He does the same to me.
Don't be so hard on him.

88
00:06:37,647 > 00:06:39,524
Okay, no big deal.

89
00:06:40,149 > 00:06:44,028
Everything he does,
he does because he loves you.

90
00:06:44,612 > 00:06:48,116
You know all I want from him is time.

91
00:06:49,033 > 00:06:52,161
But it's fine.
I won't make a big deal out of it.

92
00:06:52,245 > 00:06:53,496
Great.

93
00:06:53,579 > 00:06:57,333
So, tell me, how's the shop?
Have you settled on a name?

94
00:06:57,416 > 00:06:58,459
No,

95
00:06:59,001 > 00:07:00,753
but we're really close.

96
00:07:00,837 > 00:07:06,592
And I was thinking
I could celebrate my birthday there

97
00:07:06,676 > 00:07:10,847
and I wanted to know
if you think you'll make it here by then.

98
00:07:10,930 > 00:07:16,519
Uh... Well, darling, we actually
wanted to talk to you about that.

99
00:07:16,602 > 00:07:20,314
Something's come up
that your dad needs to resolve

100
00:07:20,398 > 00:07:22,775
and we had to postpone our return.

101
00:07:22,859 > 00:07:24,068
I'm sorry.

102
00:07:25,278 > 00:07:29,574
Don't be like that.
Look on the bright side, darling.

103
00:07:29,657 > 00:07:32,034
You'll be home alone.

104
00:07:32,118 > 00:07:36,289
With the house to yourself.
I have something to tell you.

105
00:07:36,372 > 00:07:39,375
We have a surprise for you
that you're going to love.

106
00:07:39,459 > 00:07:40,585
Mmhmm.

107
00:07:40,668 > 00:07:44,213
Go to Roberto's office
in three hours, okay?

108
00:07:44,297 > 00:07:45,423
What?

109
00:07:45,923 > 00:07:47,508
Okay, hugs.

110
00:07:47,592 > 00:07:49,677
Sorry, I have another call.

111
00:07:49,760 > 00:07:52,805
Hugs, darling. Take care. Mwah!

112
00:07:52,889 > 00:07:54,307
Bye.

113
00:07:54,390 > 00:07:55,558
I love you, Mom.

114
00:08:04,400 > 00:08:06,068
What was that kiss about?

115
00:08:06,152 > 00:08:10,364
I was celebrating your win.
Don't give me that bullshit, Leo.

116
00:08:10,448 > 00:08:12,867
Romi, don't be like that. It's all good.

117
00:08:12,950 > 00:08:14,494
Enough, Leo.

118
00:08:14,994 > 00:08:16,120
Enough.

119
00:08:17,288 > 00:08:19,707
We broke up a long time ago.

120
00:08:20,708 > 00:08:21,667
I know.

121
00:08:22,543 > 00:08:26,672
Romi, I know we broke up,
but we still love each other.

122
00:08:26,756 > 00:08:29,759
Don't deny it, honey.
I can see it in your eyes.

123
00:08:31,052 > 00:08:34,013
You know exactly why we broke up.

124
00:08:34,096 > 00:08:38,059
How many times do I have to tell you
I didn't choose the family I got?

125
00:08:39,227 > 00:08:40,770
You're absolutely right, Leo.

126
00:08:41,479 > 00:08:43,064
You can't choose your family,

127
00:08:43,606 > 00:08:47,735
but you did choose
to join your brothers' shady business.

128
00:08:48,486 > 00:08:50,363
You know who's to blame?

129
00:08:50,905 > 00:08:52,782
The people in this town.

130
00:08:52,865 > 00:08:55,368
There'd be no business without them.

131
00:08:55,451 > 00:08:59,789
It's transactional. They need money.
We give it to them. That's it.

132
00:08:59,872 > 00:09:03,251
People are happy
once they're flush with cash.

133
00:09:03,334 > 00:09:05,461
You're shameless.

134
00:09:06,337 > 00:09:10,466
Do you know how screwed people are
once they pay the interest you charge?

135
00:09:10,550 > 00:09:14,136
Do you know what your brother does
when folks can't pay on time?

136
00:09:14,220 > 00:09:16,847
Should I tell you?
I'm getting out.

137
00:09:16,931 > 00:09:19,934
I'm going to leave this neighborhood,
my brothers, my family,

138
00:09:20,017 > 00:09:21,435
all this shit, Romi.

139
00:09:24,480 > 00:09:26,232
Because I want you back.

140
00:09:27,024 > 00:09:29,235
And I'll do it for you.

141
00:09:31,279 > 00:09:34,782
It's great that
you want to change. Really.

142
00:09:34,865 > 00:09:36,367
I'm so happy for you.

143
00:09:37,118 > 00:09:39,704
But if you're going to change,
change for yourself.

144
00:09:40,413 > 00:09:41,956
Not for me.

145
00:09:42,039 > 00:09:43,165
Okay.

146
00:09:44,125 > 00:09:46,252
I'll change for both of us, then.

147
00:09:54,885 > 00:09:57,972
Why so sad, Laurita?

148
00:09:58,556 > 00:10:02,101
How'd you know?
Oh!

149
00:10:02,602 > 00:10:04,937
You must've had a fight
with your boyfriend.

150
00:10:05,021 > 00:10:06,230
Oh.

151
00:10:07,481 > 00:10:10,359
Keep your disdain for Santiago
to yourself, Rubén.

152
00:10:10,443 > 00:10:14,322
The thing is I've known you
since you were up to here on me.

153
00:10:14,405 > 00:10:15,489
Don't you remember?

154
00:10:15,573 > 00:10:18,951
But time flies, doesn't it?

155
00:10:19,452 > 00:10:20,286
Mmm.

156
00:10:21,662 > 00:10:23,998
I sometimes think it's quite the opposite.

157
00:10:25,124 > 00:10:30,296
I think time drags when you're bored.

158
00:10:30,379 > 00:10:32,548
What are you complaining about, love?

159
00:10:32,632 > 00:10:35,551
You should be grateful
for all your privilege.

160
00:10:35,635 > 00:10:38,304
Please lay off the scolding, Rubén.

161
00:10:38,387 > 00:10:40,931
I'm not scolding you.
I want you to understand

162
00:10:41,015 > 00:10:45,645
that now that you're an adult
you can do more than before.

163
00:10:47,021 > 00:10:48,898
Like have my own bakery.

164
00:10:49,607 > 00:10:53,861
For example. Or study in Paris,
like you've always dreamed of doing.

165
00:11:10,795 > 00:11:14,423
Look, Ma!
Another for the collection!

166
00:11:14,924 > 00:11:17,676
You can't imagine the epic fall I had.

167
00:11:17,760 > 00:11:19,887
It was quite the tumble at the end.

168
00:11:19,970 > 00:11:22,223
You should've seen it.
I was flying at first.

169
00:11:22,306 > 00:11:24,392
I almost fell, but...

170
00:11:34,485 > 00:11:36,278
What are you doing here?

171
00:11:36,362 > 00:11:38,614
How are you, honey?

172
00:11:39,949 > 00:11:43,411
A little bird told me
you won the race. Congratulations.

173
00:11:43,494 > 00:11:46,831
Nice! Yes, we can. Yes, we can.

174
00:11:46,914 > 00:11:49,458
Congratulations, my ass, Marlon. Get out.

175
00:11:49,542 > 00:11:53,295
Watch that tone. It's rude
and we're here to congratulate you.

176
00:11:53,379 > 00:11:56,006
Relax, honey, we're here to talk.

177
00:11:56,715 > 00:11:58,843
I heard what you said to that journalist.

178
00:11:59,969 > 00:12:02,638
I have ears to the ground
in this neighborhood, honey.

179
00:12:02,721 > 00:12:06,976
Well, honey, what I said to the journalist
isn't news to anyone.

180
00:12:07,059 > 00:12:09,603
And know that this is my neighborhood too.

181
00:12:09,687 > 00:12:13,107
Romina, dear.
Don't "Romina, dear" me, Ma.

182
00:12:13,983 > 00:12:16,819
I'll say to your face
what I said to that journalist.

183
00:12:17,319 > 00:12:20,448
You're a plague
that's screwed over the neighborhood.

184
00:12:21,073 > 00:12:22,908
You should be ashamed of yourselves.

185
00:12:24,952 > 00:12:28,873
I'm so sorry we rub you the wrong way.

186
00:12:28,956 > 00:12:32,376
Because we got along fine
when your mom asked for a loan, right?

187
00:12:33,294 > 00:12:35,087
It's almost time to pay up, right?

188
00:12:37,590 > 00:12:38,507
How much?

189
00:12:43,471 > 00:12:46,891
Since you want nothing to do with us,

190
00:12:46,974 > 00:12:49,935
pay me and I'll leave you alone.

191
00:12:50,728 > 00:12:51,687
How much?

192
00:12:57,902 > 00:12:59,320
Ask your mom.

193
00:13:00,237 > 00:13:01,572
Two weeks.

194
00:13:02,448 > 00:13:06,744
You have two weeks to pay me
what you owe me plus interest.

195
00:13:07,411 > 00:13:10,206
Or else we'll come and clear this pigsty.

196
00:13:10,831 > 00:13:11,832
Understood?

197
00:13:15,669 > 00:13:16,837
Good evening.

198
00:13:19,882 > 00:13:23,344
I'll see to it.
Otherwise, I'll take Ebony.

199
00:13:32,144 > 00:13:33,479
How much is it, Ma?

200
00:13:37,149 > 00:13:39,818
Maybe that'll
shut that snitch up.

201
00:13:39,902 > 00:13:42,154
And if it doesn't?
Guess.

202
00:13:42,988 > 00:13:44,198
Stitches.

203
00:13:45,824 > 00:13:47,201
Leo isn't going to like it

204
00:13:47,284 > 00:13:50,204
when he finds out we came by
Romina and her mom's place.

205
00:13:50,287 > 00:13:53,123
Leo needs to end
this stupid fling with that girl.

206
00:13:53,207 > 00:13:54,917
I don't get that guy.

207
00:13:55,000 > 00:13:57,002
He's always like that with women.

208
00:13:57,086 > 00:14:00,172
Don't you understand
we're not like everyone else?

209
00:14:00,256 > 00:14:03,884
We're the Chitiva brothers
and we kneel before no one.

210
00:14:04,385 > 00:14:05,511
Much less for love.

211
00:14:08,847 > 00:14:13,561
Your parents put this money
in a trust for you to have

212
00:14:13,644 > 00:14:15,813
when you turned 21.

213
00:14:15,896 > 00:14:19,066
And since that's in a few weeks,

214
00:14:19,817 > 00:14:21,026
well, here we are.

215
00:14:22,778 > 00:14:25,197
Wait. What is this?

216
00:14:25,281 > 00:14:26,115
Well,

217
00:14:27,032 > 00:14:30,578
consider it a living inheritance.
You can think of it that way.

218
00:14:33,372 > 00:14:35,624
So, all this money is for me?

219
00:14:35,708 > 00:14:36,542
Yes, ma'am.

220
00:14:36,625 > 00:14:39,211
For whatever I want?
For whatever you want.

221
00:14:41,088 > 00:14:45,384
There is one condition
for the disbursement.

222
00:14:45,467 > 00:14:46,886
One condition?

223
00:14:48,012 > 00:14:48,971
Right.

224
00:14:49,638 > 00:14:51,765
There are always conditions with my dad.

225
00:14:51,849 > 00:14:53,809
It's a simple condition.

226
00:14:55,144 > 00:14:58,522
Your parents are always
thinking of your future.

227
00:14:59,356 > 00:15:02,943
And your dad is very happy
about your business venture,

228
00:15:03,027 > 00:15:05,362
the bakery.

229
00:15:05,446 > 00:15:06,655
Get to it, Roberto.

230
00:15:07,197 > 00:15:13,996
Your father wants you to join
the family business right away

231
00:15:14,663 > 00:15:19,376
so that you can gain experience
in all areas

232
00:15:19,460 > 00:15:22,379
just in case, at some point,
hopefully not soon,

233
00:15:23,297 > 00:15:24,131
well,

234
00:15:24,840 > 00:15:27,343
you can replace him.

235
00:15:46,070 > 00:15:48,405
"Where champions become legends."

236
00:15:50,699 > 00:15:53,410
Mom, you borrowed the money for this?

237
00:15:53,494 > 00:15:57,081
Of course.
How else did you think we bought Ebony?

238
00:15:58,540 > 00:15:59,708
Excuse me?

239
00:16:00,542 > 00:16:03,837
Yeah. And going to Italy
costs a ton of money, too.

240
00:16:03,921 > 00:16:06,674
You have to take all those toys
so you don't get rusty.

241
00:16:07,466 > 00:16:10,886
You're brave and strong.
You deserve all the opportunities.

242
00:16:13,222 > 00:16:14,306
Ma.

243
00:16:15,933 > 00:16:19,228
Thank you so much
for doing this for me, really.

244
00:16:19,895 > 00:16:21,897
But we're selling that bicycle.

245
00:16:21,981 > 00:16:23,232
No, ma'am.
Yes.

246
00:16:23,315 > 00:16:27,194
Nobody's selling anything. It's my issue.
Maybe I'll sell more empanadas,

247
00:16:27,277 > 00:16:29,822
get another job, sell lottery tickets.
I don't know.

248
00:16:29,905 > 00:16:34,118
I'll do what I have to do.
You focus on training, it's important.

249
00:16:34,201 > 00:16:37,287
Sweetheart, you're almost 21.

250
00:16:37,371 > 00:16:40,916
I want all your talent
to take you far away from here.

251
00:16:41,000 > 00:16:45,004
Far away? Far away
is where I'll send the Chitivas brothers.

252
00:16:45,087 > 00:16:47,715
Are you still on that, Romina?
Stop. Look at me.

253
00:16:47,798 > 00:16:50,300
These people are dangerous.
Please, sweetheart.

254
00:16:50,384 > 00:16:53,929
Look, Ma, if I'm not afraid of taking
on those hills without brakes,

255
00:16:54,013 > 00:16:56,098
why would I be afraid of those idiots?

256
00:16:56,181 > 00:16:58,600
Enough, Romina. Please, sweetheart.

257
00:16:58,684 > 00:17:01,562
Be careful. If not for yourself,
then for me.

258
00:17:01,645 > 00:17:03,439
Stay away from those people.

259
00:17:08,318 > 00:17:10,154
Ebony, Ma? Seriously?

260
00:17:15,951 > 00:17:20,497
No, Santiago. It's not a gift.
It's a trap.

261
00:17:20,581 > 00:17:22,833
A trap?
You're blowing it out of proportion.

262
00:17:22,916 > 00:17:26,628
Santiago, my dad is tying me down
with all this money.

263
00:17:26,712 > 00:17:29,131
But say yes. It's a ton of money.

264
00:17:29,214 > 00:17:31,800
Say yes to all of his conditions.

265
00:17:31,884 > 00:17:36,180
No, Santi. That's not the point.
My dad's always like this.

266
00:17:36,930 > 00:17:40,642
Everything has hidden intentions,
the price to pay is too high,

267
00:17:40,726 > 00:17:43,312
and this time,
I'm not sure I want to pay the price.

268
00:17:43,395 > 00:17:46,899
Baby, it makes sense to me
that your dad wants you to learn the ropes

269
00:17:46,982 > 00:17:48,150
of the family business,

270
00:17:48,233 > 00:17:52,112
so that you can eventually take it over.
It makes sense.

271
00:17:53,947 > 00:17:56,200
But you know I don't want that.

272
00:17:56,825 > 00:17:58,619
How sure are you of that?

273
00:17:59,453 > 00:18:00,329
Very.

274
00:18:01,205 > 00:18:02,456
Come here.

275
00:18:03,499 > 00:18:04,958
Let's think about it.

276
00:18:07,920 > 00:18:09,546
I've thought about it.

277
00:18:10,172 > 00:18:14,551
Santi, when my dad realizes
what I'm doing with the money,

278
00:18:14,635 > 00:18:16,136
it'll be too late

279
00:18:16,220 > 00:18:20,099
and eventually he'll learn
that he can't manipulate me.

280
00:18:20,599 > 00:18:22,267
Mmm.
Okay.

281
00:18:22,351 > 00:18:24,186
Don't laugh. I'm serious.
Okay.

282
00:18:24,269 > 00:18:28,482
I'm going to use it for my bakery,
for my brand,

283
00:18:28,982 > 00:18:31,735
my business, because that's my dream.

284
00:18:32,694 > 00:18:38,742
I won't be an extension or shadow
of anybody, Santiago. Period.

285
00:18:38,826 > 00:18:40,661
That's great.

286
00:18:41,328 > 00:18:44,790
I'll support you. It's all good.
Mmhmm.

287
00:18:44,873 > 00:18:46,250
I have a question for you.

288
00:18:46,333 > 00:18:47,668
What about Paris?

289
00:18:48,377 > 00:18:49,545
Paris is on.

290
00:18:49,628 > 00:18:53,423
Paris is on?
Mmhmm. I'll take part in the workshops.

291
00:18:53,966 > 00:18:57,136
I'll come back full of new ideas.

292
00:18:58,011 > 00:18:59,429
And, when I return...

293
00:19:00,848 > 00:19:04,685
I'll leave this house
that you know I've always found lonely.

294
00:19:05,519 > 00:19:07,855
Two things.
Mmhmm.

295
00:19:07,938 > 00:19:10,774
First, you'll never feel lonely again

296
00:19:10,858 > 00:19:12,693
so long as you're with me.
Mmhmm.

297
00:19:12,776 > 00:19:14,194
Got it?
Mmhmm.

298
00:19:14,278 > 00:19:17,656
Okay, second thing. I'm going with you.

299
00:19:19,324 > 00:19:20,576
If you want.

300
00:19:21,994 > 00:19:24,246
We're going to Paris?
Together.

301
00:19:24,329 > 00:19:25,205
Oui.

302
00:19:35,632 > 00:19:37,885
What's your name?
Romina Páez.

303
00:19:38,427 > 00:19:43,265
We have to turn the car into a helicopter
because we have to do 400,000 errands.

304
00:19:43,348 > 00:19:44,850
Why?

305
00:19:44,933 > 00:19:46,435
What happened to you?

306
00:19:46,518 > 00:19:49,938
Your sugar is high. I knew
I shouldn't have given you chocolate.

307
00:19:50,022 > 00:19:51,273
Look.

308
00:19:52,357 > 00:19:55,319
Of course, but...
Who's that?

309
00:19:55,402 > 00:19:57,112
...this sport isn't very feminine.

310
00:19:58,071 > 00:20:00,657
She has your voice.
The two of you are identical.

311
00:20:00,741 > 00:20:03,327
Living in this neighborhood.
That takes bravery.

312
00:20:03,410 > 00:20:04,995
"BE POSITIVE"
IN DOWNHILL RACE

313
00:20:05,078 > 00:20:06,872
That's so weird, Rubén.

314
00:20:06,955 > 00:20:10,584
Because this neighborhood
is full of moneylenders, loan sharks,

315
00:20:10,667 > 00:20:14,129
and payday lenders.
They're screwing over the neighborhood.

316
00:20:27,684 > 00:20:28,685
Damn.

317
00:20:29,811 > 00:20:30,687
Hey...

318
00:20:31,813 > 00:20:36,109
Tell me something, officer.
Do you want to die young?

319
00:20:37,361 > 00:20:38,779
It's great seeing you again.

320
00:20:39,321 > 00:20:42,741
Didn't your mom teach you
that before you cross the street

321
00:20:42,824 > 00:20:45,577
you should look both ways?

322
00:20:45,661 > 00:20:50,123
Did you realize you were riding into me
instead of around me?

323
00:20:50,207 > 00:20:51,166
Or no?

324
00:20:52,709 > 00:20:54,127
Wait.

325
00:20:54,211 > 00:20:55,712
What if we...

326
00:20:56,421 > 00:20:57,881
start over?

327
00:20:59,258 > 00:21:04,221
Nice to meet you.
I'm Cristóbal Ruiz, better known as Whiz.

328
00:21:05,389 > 00:21:08,433
Whiz! How humble.

329
00:21:08,517 > 00:21:11,937
That's what people around here call me.
But you know what?

330
00:21:12,020 > 00:21:14,564
I don't want to miss my chance
to congratulate you.

331
00:21:14,648 > 00:21:18,819
For two things.
First: that elegant jump you did.

332
00:21:18,902 > 00:21:21,196
Really, you have all my respect.

333
00:21:21,280 > 00:21:24,074
Second: for having won
that really difficult race.

334
00:21:24,157 > 00:21:27,494
You really have my respect
and admiration too.

335
00:21:28,662 > 00:21:31,456
Could the two of us chat for a minute?

336
00:21:31,999 > 00:21:33,709
Come on, Cristóbal.

337
00:21:34,251 > 00:21:36,920
I'll tell you the truth,
so you don't waste your time.

338
00:21:38,005 > 00:21:39,798
I'm not interested in dating.

339
00:21:40,340 > 00:21:42,718
How do you know what I'm going to say?

340
00:21:44,594 > 00:21:46,471
I don't, so tell me.

341
00:21:47,264 > 00:21:51,059
I'd like to talk about the loan sharks
you mentioned to the journalist.

342
00:21:52,102 > 00:21:55,731
It's an issue I'm very interested in.
Do you have a minute?

343
00:21:57,816 > 00:22:00,944
Basically, there's a monopoly
of moneylenders,

344
00:22:01,028 > 00:22:05,657
loan sharks and payday lenders
by one neighborhood family

345
00:22:05,741 > 00:22:07,868
and we all know exactly who they are.

346
00:22:08,368 > 00:22:10,245
Who?
The Chitiva brothers.

347
00:22:11,747 > 00:22:13,165
The Chitiva brothers.

348
00:22:14,124 > 00:22:17,002
Do you know how many of them there are?
Three.

349
00:22:18,337 > 00:22:21,006
Benny, Leo and Marlon.

350
00:22:22,758 > 00:22:26,094
And what do they do exactly?

351
00:22:26,178 > 00:22:29,473
Imagine they're an illegal bank.

352
00:22:29,556 > 00:22:31,725
They lend money to people

353
00:22:31,808 > 00:22:34,394
and then charge
astronomical interest rates.

354
00:22:34,478 > 00:22:37,564
Mr. Gonzalo, if you don't pay monthly,
the interest increases.

355
00:22:38,106 > 00:22:40,067
And if you get behind on payments

356
00:22:40,734 > 00:22:44,112
I have to call a friend of mine
with a wicked temper.

357
00:22:44,196 > 00:22:46,073
Don't worry, Mr. Marlon.

358
00:22:46,782 > 00:22:48,033
I'll pay on time.

359
00:22:48,784 > 00:22:50,702
You have to.

360
00:22:50,786 > 00:22:53,705
Do you know what they do
if people don't pay up?

361
00:22:54,289 > 00:22:55,957
I can imagine.

362
00:22:56,041 > 00:23:00,003
They break into their homes and businesses
and steal what little they have.

363
00:23:00,087 > 00:23:02,923
That's how they collect.
Things are going to change.

364
00:23:03,590 > 00:23:06,259
I'll see to it myself.
Mmm.

365
00:23:06,343 > 00:23:09,179
What do you say, kitty cat? Let's toast.
Yeah.

366
00:23:09,262 > 00:23:10,847
Business is good.

367
00:23:11,515 > 00:23:12,849
To the family.

368
00:23:12,933 > 00:23:14,976
Just like that.
Cheers.

369
00:23:19,523 > 00:23:21,650
Hey, what are you doing with my chain?

370
00:23:21,733 > 00:23:24,736
I'm borrowing it
because I'm going to a honey's place.

371
00:23:24,820 > 00:23:27,114
Ooh la la!
Hey!

372
00:23:27,197 > 00:23:28,198
Who?

373
00:23:29,950 > 00:23:31,034
Romina.

374
00:23:34,788 > 00:23:35,664
This is mine.

375
00:23:37,165 > 00:23:41,670
Marlon, I want to ask you something else.
I know about Yesenia's debt.

376
00:23:41,753 > 00:23:43,797
Don't go so hard on the old lady.

377
00:23:43,880 > 00:23:47,259
Who are you defending?
The old lady or Romina?

378
00:23:47,342 > 00:23:54,266
Come on, man. Leave that one to me.
You know I'll get that money back.

379
00:23:54,349 > 00:23:55,433
You know what, Leo?

380
00:23:56,101 > 00:24:00,272
You're trying to rein in that goat
and she's sicced the police on us.

381
00:24:04,025 > 00:24:07,487
If you don't give that account to me,
I'm leaving all this shit behind

382
00:24:07,571 > 00:24:09,030
because I'm sick and tired.

383
00:24:09,114 > 00:24:11,116
I want to make money some other way.

384
00:24:11,199 > 00:24:12,826
Check out the balls on this one.

385
00:24:12,909 > 00:24:14,035
What's going on?

386
00:24:14,703 > 00:24:17,998
Have you forgotten about family loyalty?

387
00:24:20,625 > 00:24:21,960
If you leave,

388
00:24:22,544 > 00:24:25,130
Romina will come out losing.
Don't mess with her.

389
00:24:25,213 > 00:24:28,967
Hey, calm down.
Nobody's leaving. It's all good.

390
00:24:29,885 > 00:24:31,261
Cut the shit now.

391
00:24:31,887 > 00:24:32,846
Calm down.

392
00:24:32,929 > 00:24:35,640
Nothing will happen to her
if she keeps her trap shut.

393
00:24:35,724 > 00:24:36,850
Or to you

394
00:24:37,392 > 00:24:39,811
if you don't forget where you belong.

395
00:24:43,023 > 00:24:44,316
Enough.

396
00:24:47,527 > 00:24:48,528
Relax.

397
00:25:02,417 > 00:25:04,711
NEWS

398
00:25:16,264 > 00:25:20,227
Laurita, I have good news and bad news.
Mmm.

399
00:25:20,769 > 00:25:22,479
Start with the bad news.

400
00:25:23,146 > 00:25:26,233
I waited for no reason
because the journalist has no idea

401
00:25:26,316 > 00:25:28,443
where your doppelganger lives.

402
00:25:29,152 > 00:25:33,198
But I asked her about
the neighborhood they were filming in,

403
00:25:33,281 > 00:25:34,783
where the race was.

404
00:25:34,866 > 00:25:37,702
Oh, perfect. Let's go then.

405
00:25:37,786 > 00:25:39,621
No. Let's not go.

406
00:25:40,330 > 00:25:44,000
The neighborhood is far away and dangerous
and I don't want you to go.

407
00:25:44,084 > 00:25:45,377
So?

408
00:25:45,460 > 00:25:49,047
I'll go first thing tomorrow morning

409
00:25:49,631 > 00:25:51,508
and I'll figure this out calmly.

410
00:25:51,591 > 00:25:54,344
You know I could go with you, Rubencho.

411
00:25:54,427 > 00:25:59,224
I said no. No, Laurita.
What if something happens? You never know.

412
00:25:59,307 > 00:26:01,351
What would I say to your parents?

413
00:26:01,434 > 00:26:03,937
No, leave it to me. No worries.

414
00:26:04,020 > 00:26:05,313
Well, okay.

415
00:26:05,939 > 00:26:07,649
So, what was the good news?

416
00:26:07,732 > 00:26:09,234
Oh, yeah.

417
00:26:11,945 > 00:26:12,862
Bitter.

418
00:26:12,946 > 00:26:14,531
How I like it.
Yeah.

419
00:26:15,740 > 00:26:17,409
Thanks, Rubencho.
No.

420
00:26:19,786 > 00:26:20,912
FEDERAL POLICE

421
00:26:20,996 > 00:26:22,289
Major.

422
00:26:22,372 > 00:26:25,417
I'm asking for more
patrol officers in La Mirla.

423
00:26:25,500 > 00:26:28,837
To learn how loansharking works
there so we can stop it.

424
00:26:32,799 > 00:26:34,592
Let me tell you something, Ruiz.

425
00:26:35,093 > 00:26:40,348
You're a renowned, judicious,
disciplined and effective officer.

426
00:26:40,932 > 00:26:45,270
But sometimes you have too much zeal.
I don't know if that's a good thing.

427
00:26:45,895 > 00:26:47,897
I just want things to work.

428
00:26:48,523 > 00:26:51,276
To work well, quickly, and effectively.

429
00:26:52,444 > 00:26:54,070
And I can make that happen.

430
00:26:56,448 > 00:26:58,199
You're confident, eh, Sergeant?

431
00:26:59,159 > 00:27:00,160
Very.

432
00:27:01,119 > 00:27:03,121
Imagine if you were confident in me too.

433
00:27:03,872 > 00:27:05,457
Everything would be sorted.

434
00:27:08,626 > 00:27:10,879
I'll do one thing.
Two more patrol cars there.

435
00:27:12,339 > 00:27:13,631
But listen up.

436
00:27:13,715 > 00:27:16,551
It's important that people report it.

437
00:27:16,634 > 00:27:20,555
Otherwise, we won't do anything.
Just be present and patrol, nothing more.

438
00:27:21,264 > 00:27:23,475
What's important?
That people report it.

439
00:27:23,558 > 00:27:26,269
That people report it.
Yes, sir.

440
00:27:26,978 > 00:27:28,813
You are dismissed.
Yes, sir.

441
00:27:31,399 > 00:27:33,818
What Ramón says is true.
What?

442
00:27:34,486 > 00:27:36,905
That people are happy

443
00:27:37,530 > 00:27:39,449
because there are patrol cars around.

444
00:27:39,532 > 00:27:42,452
Talking to that reporter worked out, eh?

445
00:27:42,535 > 00:27:45,580
Or maybe something else worked.

446
00:27:45,663 > 00:27:47,374
Something else?

447
00:27:47,457 > 00:27:50,126
Some cop who's putting in the work.

448
00:27:50,210 > 00:27:52,712
A cop?
Some guy named Cristóbal.

449
00:27:53,546 > 00:27:54,839
Oh, Whiz.

450
00:27:54,923 > 00:27:58,218
What do you mean, "Oh, Whiz"?
Is he famous?

451
00:27:58,301 > 00:28:01,554
No, he's not famous, but he is hot.

452
00:28:01,638 > 00:28:02,806
Isn't he?
Yeah?

453
00:28:02,889 > 00:28:05,016
Have you seen his lower back?

454
00:28:05,100 > 00:28:06,476
See it often or what?

455
00:28:06,559 > 00:28:08,561
Smitten for authority figures.

456
00:28:08,645 > 00:28:13,316
Hey, no.
You know I'm enjoying being single.

457
00:28:13,400 > 00:28:15,610
Ah.
With all my toys, girl.

458
00:28:16,194 > 00:28:17,862
Girl likes to play.

459
00:28:18,446 > 00:28:19,906
Oh, so silly.

460
00:28:20,824 > 00:28:21,950
No, girl.

461
00:28:22,033 > 00:28:23,993
Until someone great comes around...

462
00:28:24,536 > 00:28:26,162
No way in hell.
No way in hell.

463
00:28:26,246 > 00:28:27,372
Awesome, girl.

464
00:28:28,039 > 00:28:32,210
But it seems like someone likes Whiz.

465
00:28:32,961 > 00:28:33,878
Am I wrong?

466
00:28:35,171 > 00:28:37,841
Oh, I don't even recognize you.

467
00:28:37,924 > 00:28:39,592
You like a cop, Romina?

468
00:28:40,385 > 00:28:41,594
You like a cop?

469
00:28:41,678 > 00:28:44,848
No, Nayibe, I don't like him.
I'm head over heels for him.

470
00:28:44,931 > 00:28:47,350
Girl...
I can't stop thinking about him.

471
00:28:47,434 > 00:28:48,476
What should I do?

472
00:28:50,687 > 00:28:52,689
Your tastes vary, eh?

473
00:28:52,772 > 00:28:54,733
From Leo to a cop,

474
00:28:54,816 > 00:28:57,026
quite the leap you took.

475
00:28:58,111 > 00:28:59,738
Over here, please.

476
00:29:01,030 > 00:29:02,073
Thank you.

477
00:29:09,998 > 00:29:11,040
Alright.

478
00:29:11,708 > 00:29:13,042
Hello.

479
00:29:13,126 > 00:29:15,879
Do you happen to know Romina Páez,

480
00:29:15,962 > 00:29:19,883
the girl on the news
who won the bike race?

481
00:29:19,966 > 00:29:22,635
Yeah. Is it for another interview?

482
00:29:22,719 > 00:29:25,638
Yes, but we have to keep it quiet
because it's a secret.

483
00:29:25,722 > 00:29:28,433
Romina is going to be so famous.

484
00:29:28,516 > 00:29:32,145
Do you know where she lives?
Down this street, by the park.

485
00:29:32,228 > 00:29:36,316
You'll see colorful stairs
and in the middle, there's a blue house.

486
00:29:36,399 > 00:29:39,527
It has a drawing of a woman
with the body of a horse.

487
00:29:40,195 > 00:29:44,324
It's a centaur, Romina's signature.
Alright, thank you.

488
00:29:44,407 > 00:29:45,909
Sure thing.
Bye.

489
00:29:45,992 > 00:29:48,244
Enough.
What?

490
00:29:53,041 > 00:29:55,627
No, please leave it. No.
No, please.

491
00:29:55,710 > 00:29:58,797
Please don't take our things.
It's all we have.

492
00:29:58,880 > 00:30:00,799
Those bastards have no respect.

493
00:30:00,882 > 00:30:03,885
Without us,
these people would lose their homes.

494
00:30:03,968 > 00:30:05,053
Even the rafters.

495
00:30:05,762 > 00:30:09,224
They're rats, sewer rats.
Yeah.

496
00:30:10,600 > 00:30:13,061
Report it to Benítez.
Alright.

497
00:30:13,603 > 00:30:15,271
Guarín to Benítez, do you copy?

498
00:30:16,022 > 00:30:17,482
Benítez here.

499
00:30:17,565 > 00:30:20,860
We're going to stake out
here in block 14. There are shady guys.

500
00:30:20,944 > 00:30:22,612
Copy, go ahead.

501
00:30:28,076 > 00:30:32,121
I've been waiting for you.
Empty that quickly, man.

502
00:30:33,790 > 00:30:38,378
Hi, boss. The order arrived.
Yes, sir. What do we do with it then?

503
00:30:38,461 > 00:30:40,046
Shall we go ahead?

504
00:30:40,129 > 00:30:42,382
As you wish. Alright.

505
00:30:42,465 > 00:30:44,801
67. Let's do what we came here for.

506
00:30:46,010 > 00:30:49,848
Hurry. That junk needs to be disassembled
and sold for parts.

507
00:30:49,931 > 00:30:54,018
We'll make more. Marlon's orders. Quickly.

508
00:30:55,478 > 00:30:58,439
National Police.
Don't move. National Police. Hands up.

509
00:30:59,065 > 00:31:02,819
What's going on? I haven't done anything.
Those goods are stolen.

510
00:31:02,902 > 00:31:05,655
No, it's all legal. It's collateral.

511
00:31:05,738 > 00:31:07,073
This is being seized

512
00:31:07,156 > 00:31:11,536
and you're being charged
with robbery and extortion. Arrest them!

513
00:31:11,619 > 00:31:12,787
Let's go. Arrest them!

514
00:31:12,871 > 00:31:15,915
Let's go. Against the wall.

515
00:31:15,999 > 00:31:17,834
You have the right to remain silent.

516
00:31:17,917 > 00:31:20,837
Anything you say can be used against you
in a court of law.

517
00:31:28,428 > 00:31:30,513
I found her.
Yeah?

518
00:31:30,597 > 00:31:31,931
Yes.
High five.

519
00:31:32,015 > 00:31:33,308
Well done.
Look.

520
00:31:39,522 > 00:31:40,732
Ready, babe?

521
00:31:41,816 > 00:31:45,028
What are you doing here?
Did you forget I was picking you up?

522
00:31:45,111 > 00:31:48,489
No, Mari,
but I have to do a thousand errands for...

523
00:31:48,573 > 00:31:51,618
Forget it, you don't know
what it took to get the appointment

524
00:31:51,701 > 00:31:56,706
with the planner you wanted.
You don't turn 21 every day, friend.

525
00:31:56,789 > 00:32:00,376
So, get in the car
because we're leaving now.

526
00:32:01,294 > 00:32:02,378
Okay.

527
00:32:04,255 > 00:32:06,132
Hi. How are you?
Hi.

528
00:32:07,926 > 00:32:11,888
And Rubencito let it slip

529
00:32:11,971 > 00:32:15,767
that there won't be parents around
for the party of the year.

530
00:32:16,392 > 00:32:20,021
It'll be a blowout, Mari.
That it will.

531
00:32:22,607 > 00:32:25,944
That whole gang was arrested.
Really?

532
00:32:27,111 > 00:32:30,907
What? You don't trust me?

533
00:32:30,990 > 00:32:34,327
No, wait,
it's not that I don't believe you.

534
00:32:34,994 > 00:32:37,956
It's that I'm impressed
by how quickly you acted.

535
00:32:38,623 > 00:32:40,750
The party's over for them, Romina.

536
00:32:40,833 > 00:32:44,754
It was a warning so they know
they can't mess with the community.

537
00:32:45,505 > 00:32:46,756
Well, awesome.

538
00:32:48,049 > 00:32:49,550
Listen, Cristóbal.

539
00:32:50,385 > 00:32:54,430
I'm starting to think
your nickname suits you, Whiz.

540
00:32:54,514 > 00:32:56,140
Oh, yeah?
Mmm.

541
00:32:57,058 > 00:32:58,017
So, tell me.

542
00:32:58,518 > 00:33:02,689
Does it suit me enough
to get me an outing or not yet?

543
00:33:03,523 > 00:33:04,732
An outing?

544
00:33:04,816 > 00:33:09,779
An outing among friends,
to grab a bite, or go dancing.

545
00:33:09,862 > 00:33:10,989
Nothing more.

546
00:33:11,990 > 00:33:14,158
Would your boyfriend let you?
Boyfriend?

547
00:33:14,993 > 00:33:16,536
Yeah.
No.

548
00:33:17,036 > 00:33:18,663
I don't have a boyfriend.
No?

549
00:33:18,746 > 00:33:21,666
What about that guy
who congratulated you after the race?

550
00:33:21,749 > 00:33:24,043
No, that guy's an ex.

551
00:33:24,627 > 00:33:27,046
Does he know he's an ex?
Have you told him?

552
00:33:27,672 > 00:33:29,674
I've made it very clear to him.

553
00:33:30,842 > 00:33:32,510
So, what?
What?

554
00:33:32,593 > 00:33:33,845
What?
About what?

555
00:33:33,928 > 00:33:35,013
Are we going out?

556
00:33:36,556 > 00:33:38,266
On one condition.

557
00:33:38,349 > 00:33:40,059
Name it.

558
00:33:40,143 > 00:33:42,895
If we're going out,
it can't be in the neighborhood.

559
00:33:42,979 > 00:33:47,942
No problem. Tell me where you want to go
and I'll take you there.

560
00:33:48,026 > 00:33:49,110
Where shall we go?

561
00:33:49,193 > 00:33:52,321
I don't know, Whiz. Get creative.

562
00:33:52,405 > 00:33:54,574
Aren't you asking me out?

563
00:33:54,657 > 00:33:55,992
Okay.
Surprise me.

564
00:33:56,075 > 00:33:57,660
Alright, I'll surprise you.

565
00:33:57,744 > 00:33:59,287
Deal.
Deal.

566
00:33:59,370 > 00:34:01,873
Romina Páez.
Deal, Whiz.

567
00:34:08,337 > 00:34:11,007
No. Who's that bombshell?

568
00:34:11,090 > 00:34:12,258
Where are you going?

569
00:34:12,341 > 00:34:14,469
What? Am I that ugly the rest of the time?

570
00:34:14,552 > 00:34:18,514
No, sweetheart, you're always gorgeous.
You're the prettiest and you know it.

571
00:34:19,015 > 00:34:21,476
But I want to know
why you're so dressed up.

572
00:34:22,310 > 00:34:25,146
Well, can you imagine
someone asked me out?

573
00:34:25,772 > 00:34:28,608
No, darling. Stop dragging Leo along.

574
00:34:28,691 > 00:34:32,528
Leo? Oh, no, Ms. Yesenia.
Let's get you up to date.

575
00:34:32,612 > 00:34:35,031
You think I'd go out with Leo?
Then, who?

576
00:34:35,656 > 00:34:37,158
Cristóbal Ruiz.

577
00:34:38,785 > 00:34:40,912
That nice police officer?

578
00:34:40,995 > 00:34:44,707
If you'd like I can introduce him to you
so you two can go out.

579
00:34:44,791 > 00:34:46,084
Don't be silly.

580
00:34:46,709 > 00:34:48,419
I like him for you.

581
00:34:48,503 > 00:34:51,339
Mmm.
Where are you going?

582
00:34:51,422 > 00:34:55,510
I don't know, but he's got good ideas,
so he's going to surprise me.

583
00:34:57,136 > 00:34:58,304
Later, then.

584
00:34:58,805 > 00:35:00,556
My kiss?
Take care.

585
00:35:00,640 > 00:35:01,557
Mwah.

586
00:35:03,643 > 00:35:05,978
I want you home at 12:00.

587
00:35:06,062 > 00:35:08,022
At 12:00?
Yes, ma'am.

588
00:35:08,106 > 00:35:10,691
What am I, Cinderella?
Yes, ma'am.

589
00:35:10,775 > 00:35:12,193
Come on, Ma. 1:30.

590
00:35:12,276 > 00:35:14,237
1:00!
1:15!

591
00:35:14,320 > 00:35:16,531
1:00!
1:15!

592
00:35:16,614 > 00:35:18,991
Alright, 1:15.
Alright, bye.

593
00:35:19,075 > 00:35:20,701
Take care.

594
00:35:20,785 > 00:35:22,829
Be good.
Yes, ma'am.

595
00:36:03,327 > 00:36:06,122
You sure do look different
out of your uniform.

596
00:36:06,205 > 00:36:08,249
You look beautiful too.

597
00:36:08,332 > 00:36:11,043
Give me that, I'll hold it for you.

598
00:36:13,421 > 00:36:15,339
Did you ride Ebony here?

599
00:36:15,423 > 00:36:17,466
Of course. How else would I get here?

600
00:36:21,429 > 00:36:23,556
You look phenomenal.

601
00:36:25,349 > 00:36:26,225
Oh, yes.

602
00:36:26,309 > 00:36:29,103
Thanks.
Let's order. I'm starving.

603
00:36:33,983 > 00:36:35,193
So?

604
00:36:35,902 > 00:36:39,113
So, Whiz, is this the surprise?

605
00:36:40,323 > 00:36:42,450
Look me in the eyes, Romina.

606
00:36:43,075 > 00:36:45,661
You really think this is the surprise?

607
00:36:45,745 > 00:36:46,954
I hope not.

608
00:36:47,038 > 00:36:48,873
I'm surprised.

609
00:36:48,956 > 00:36:51,500
No, this is to warm up,

610
00:36:51,584 > 00:36:54,587
grab a bite, dance a bit,

611
00:36:54,670 > 00:36:57,298
and then I'll take you
to the surprise. Alright?

612
00:36:57,381 > 00:36:59,425
Okay, but there's a small problem.

613
00:36:59,508 > 00:37:01,928
What?
What do we do with Ebony?

614
00:37:02,011 > 00:37:03,137
No problem.

615
00:37:03,221 > 00:37:07,600
We'll put Ebony in the car
my buddy lent me. It's a tank.

616
00:37:07,683 > 00:37:08,768
Your buddy?

617
00:37:10,895 > 00:37:13,064
Did you think I'd come in the patrol car?

618
00:37:14,065 > 00:37:16,817
I'm gonna steal a sip because...
Go ahead.

619
00:37:16,901 > 00:37:18,361
That bike ride and...

620
00:37:18,444 > 00:37:20,404
So, what'll we...

621
00:37:22,615 > 00:37:23,991
What do you like?

622
00:37:24,575 > 00:37:25,785
Anything's good for me.

623
00:37:28,955 > 00:37:29,997
Yeah!

624
00:37:32,917 > 00:37:35,503
Hey, do you know how to dance?

625
00:37:36,003 > 00:37:40,049
Hey, the real question is:
Do you know how to dance?

626
00:37:40,132 > 00:37:41,175
Mmm.

627
00:38:42,653 > 00:38:46,240
Have you noticed
that we even dance similarly?

628
00:38:46,324 > 00:38:47,366
Oh, yeah?

629
00:38:48,242 > 00:38:50,911
How else are we similar?

630
00:38:51,454 > 00:38:52,413
Let's see.

631
00:38:53,039 > 00:38:55,583
We both like going fast, right?

632
00:38:56,083 > 00:38:58,377
We like to win too.

633
00:38:59,211 > 00:39:02,590
We like helping people.
Mmm.

634
00:39:02,673 > 00:39:05,384
Among other things, but you know what?
What?

635
00:39:06,302 > 00:39:09,430
Sometimes, I also think...

636
00:39:10,514 > 00:39:11,640
What?

637
00:39:11,724 > 00:39:14,143
Going slow is cool.
Yeah?

638
00:39:15,811 > 00:39:19,231
Yeah, well, the thing is...

639
00:39:20,900 > 00:39:23,027
going slow doesn't really work for me.

640
00:39:55,059 > 00:39:57,186
I don't know how to turn this off.

641
00:39:59,355 > 00:40:01,732
Hey, yeah!

642
00:40:02,983 > 00:40:04,819
Hello.
Hello.

643
00:40:05,903 > 00:40:08,072
This is where we're going?
Come on.

644
00:40:11,909 > 00:40:13,160
No way.

645
00:40:16,497 > 00:40:19,041
What's this beauty's name?

646
00:40:20,459 > 00:40:23,796
Wow, what a beauty!

647
00:40:23,879 > 00:40:25,798
Buddy.
Thanks, man.

648
00:40:25,881 > 00:40:28,259
My pleasure.
Hello.

649
00:40:29,760 > 00:40:31,220
Wow.

650
00:40:31,804 > 00:40:34,223
Her name is Amal.

651
00:40:34,306 > 00:40:36,100
Amal.
Yes.

652
00:40:36,183 > 00:40:37,726
I...
Hi, love.

653
00:40:37,810 > 00:40:41,605
...thought it'd be the perfect place
to bring the centaur of La Mirla.

654
00:40:43,524 > 00:40:46,152
How did you pull this off?

655
00:40:46,861 > 00:40:48,237
See...

656
00:40:49,280 > 00:40:52,450
I've got friends who are rangers
that can pull strings for me.

657
00:40:53,242 > 00:40:55,744
I should go out with your friend.

658
00:40:56,579 > 00:40:58,038
What now?

659
00:41:01,459 > 00:41:05,880
All that's left
is for us to enjoy this moment.

660
00:41:07,256 > 00:41:11,093
Now I'm surprised, Whiz.

661
00:41:13,345 > 00:41:15,055
The night is young.

662
00:41:16,474 > 00:41:18,142
I know we'll have a good time.

663
00:41:18,225 > 00:41:19,685
Me too.

664
00:43:02,955 > 00:43:04,290
MAJOR CIFUENTES
COMMANDER

665
00:43:04,373 > 00:43:07,543
A lot of the seized goods
were from the neighbors.

666
00:43:07,626 > 00:43:09,712
They were stolen to pay the loan sharks.

667
00:43:09,795 > 00:43:11,630
That's good news, Major.

668
00:43:12,590 > 00:43:15,884
Nothing happened yet.
Nobody reported the Chitiva brothers.

669
00:43:15,968 > 00:43:19,263
People say it's not them,
it's smalltime loan sharks.

670
00:43:19,346 > 00:43:22,391
No, Major.
The Chitiva brothers are involved.

671
00:43:22,474 > 00:43:24,977
The people who took things to John Alexis'

672
00:43:25,060 > 00:43:27,688
secondhand shop
work for the Chitiva brothers.

673
00:43:27,771 > 00:43:30,190
He'd rather pay than rat them out.

674
00:43:30,274 > 00:43:34,445
That's what's happening.
People are afraid to talk.

675
00:43:35,237 > 00:43:37,489
They're ruled by fear.

676
00:43:37,573 > 00:43:41,994
Prove it, Ruiz, prove it.
Get people to report the Chitiva brothers.

677
00:43:42,077 > 00:43:44,705
If you do that,
we'll have a case against them.

678
00:43:45,247 > 00:43:46,999
A case, Major?

679
00:43:47,082 > 00:43:48,167
Yes.

680
00:43:49,293 > 00:43:52,254
The first case
that you'll be in charge of in La Mirla.

681
00:43:52,338 > 00:43:54,006
Let me say something, Sergeant.

682
00:43:54,882 > 00:43:56,634
La Mirla is a rough neighborhood.

683
00:43:56,717 > 00:43:58,010
I know.

684
00:43:58,594 > 00:44:01,805
I know the responsibility it entails,
and I won't let you down.

685
00:44:03,557 > 00:44:06,226
You know what a lot of people here say?

686
00:44:06,769 > 00:44:07,936
What?

687
00:44:08,562 > 00:44:10,105
That you're too green for this.

688
00:44:10,189 > 00:44:13,025
That's what they say. Prove them wrong.

689
00:44:13,108 > 00:44:17,154
Show them I'm not wrong
for putting you in charge of this.

690
00:44:17,237 > 00:44:18,906
You're not wrong.

691
00:44:20,908 > 00:44:22,576
I promise I won't let you down.

692
00:44:22,660 > 00:44:24,161
Thank you for trusting me.

693
00:44:25,329 > 00:44:28,332
Permission to leave.
Go.

694
00:44:33,921 > 00:44:36,757
Second base right off the bat?
Yeah.

695
00:44:36,840 > 00:44:38,384
Hey, girl!

696
00:44:38,467 > 00:44:41,929
It was so awesome, Nayi.
It all just flowed.

697
00:44:42,012 > 00:44:45,057
It's like he and I
have known each other our whole lives.

698
00:44:45,140 > 00:44:48,185
In other words, it was rough, eh?

699
00:44:48,268 > 00:44:49,311
Hey!

700
00:44:50,729 > 00:44:54,858
That's the way it is. So...
So what?

701
00:44:54,942 > 00:44:56,318
What was it like?

702
00:44:57,820 > 00:45:00,948
My girl's gone shy on me.

703
00:45:01,031 > 00:45:02,366
Don't be silly.

704
00:45:02,449 > 00:45:04,118
But you know what?
What?

705
00:45:04,201 > 00:45:05,744
You seem happy.
Yeah.

706
00:45:05,828 > 00:45:07,663
And I like it. He treated you well.

707
00:45:07,746 > 00:45:10,457
Very well, girl.
As it should be, girl.

708
00:45:11,208 > 00:45:13,293
But...
But what?

709
00:45:13,377 > 00:45:14,920
There's a but.

710
00:45:15,003 > 00:45:18,048
Tell that man Whiz to keep a low profile.

711
00:45:20,134 > 00:45:22,094
You mean because of Leo?

712
00:45:22,719 > 00:45:25,931
No, not just because of that.
Then what?

713
00:45:26,598 > 00:45:30,519
It's just that Whiz sticks out
like a sore thumb here.

714
00:45:31,061 > 00:45:33,689
And you know how
the Chitiva brothers deal with that.

715
00:45:35,441 > 00:45:36,692
I know.

716
00:45:40,571 > 00:45:43,073
The house is just down this hill.

717
00:45:44,867 > 00:45:47,327
But, honey,
this neighborhood is dangerous.

718
00:45:47,411 > 00:45:50,914
So I'll wait for you in the car,

719
00:45:50,998 > 00:45:54,042
but be careful, and please come back soon.

720
00:45:54,668 > 00:45:57,004
Don't worry, Rubén. I won't be long.
I promise.

721
00:46:10,350 > 00:46:11,518
There it is.

722
00:46:16,106 > 00:46:17,941
Are you expecting someone, Ma?

723
00:46:18,025 > 00:46:21,111
No, maybe it's Esperancita
coming by for empanadas.

724
00:46:21,195 > 00:46:23,071
Okay, I'll give them to her.

725
00:46:23,989 > 00:46:25,157
Hel...

726
00:46:44,009 > 00:46:46,637
Now we know the Chitivas organization

727
00:46:46,720 > 00:46:49,806
is made up of loan sharks,
debt collectors, mercenaries,

728
00:46:49,890 > 00:46:53,018
and people who make evidence disappear.

729
00:46:53,101 > 00:46:56,313
No wonder people are scared shitless
and won't report them.

730
00:46:56,396 > 00:47:00,192
Exactly. And we need to quell that fear.

731
00:47:00,275 > 00:47:03,362
We have to turn off the water
to what we call

732
00:47:03,445 > 00:47:05,239
the faucet mafia. Are you with me?

733
00:47:05,322 > 00:47:07,824
Affirmative, Sergeant!

734
00:47:09,952 > 00:47:12,329
Please come in.

735
00:47:29,179 > 00:47:31,181
I saw you on...

736
00:47:32,599 > 00:47:37,020
the news when you were interviewed
after the race.

737
00:47:37,688 > 00:47:39,398
And well...

738
00:47:40,524 > 00:47:42,901
And well, I was stunned by...

739
00:47:44,903 > 00:47:46,780
how similar we look.

740
00:47:48,448 > 00:47:50,200
Looking at you...

741
00:47:51,034 > 00:47:52,578
in front of me now...

742
00:47:53,495 > 00:47:55,914
is like looking in a mirror.

743
00:47:59,376 > 00:48:00,544
Oof.

744
00:48:01,712 > 00:48:04,631
We're not similar, we're...

745
00:48:04,715 > 00:48:06,174
No, we're identical.

746
00:48:10,095 > 00:48:12,097
Who are you talking to, hon?

747
00:48:20,647 > 00:48:23,025
Did you know I had a doppelganger, Ma?

748
00:48:23,108 > 00:48:25,569
Eh? Like in the movies.

749
00:48:31,491 > 00:48:34,328
Hey there, what happened?

750
00:48:39,625 > 00:48:40,876
Come here.

751
00:48:42,210 > 00:48:44,880
Want some water?
I'll bring you some water.

752
00:48:55,682 > 00:48:57,517
Are you feeling better, ma'am?

753
00:48:57,601 > 00:49:00,854
Oh no, kid, don't worry. She's...

754
00:49:00,937 > 00:49:05,150
It must be quite a shock to see
how similar we look, but it's all good.

755
00:49:05,233 > 00:49:06,276
Right, Ma?

756
00:49:14,326 > 00:49:16,078
What are your parents' names?

757
00:49:16,161 > 00:49:17,454
Uh...

758
00:49:18,205 > 00:49:19,706
Sergio and Virginia Vélez.

759
00:49:21,708 > 00:49:24,670
Oh my God. Could it be?

760
00:49:26,797 > 00:49:28,840
Could what be?

761
00:49:29,966 > 00:49:31,760
I don't believe it.

762
00:49:32,844 > 00:49:34,262
I don't believe it.

763
00:49:35,222 > 00:49:40,268
No, well, Ma, explain it to us.
We don't get what's going on either.

764
00:49:41,144 > 00:49:42,354
Sweetheart.

765
00:49:42,896 > 00:49:45,065
I don't even know where to start.

766
00:49:47,359 > 00:49:49,403
Please have a seat, both of you.

767
00:49:58,620 > 00:50:00,414
What's your name?

768
00:50:01,707 > 00:50:03,125
Laura.

769
00:50:03,208 > 00:50:04,334
Laura.

770
00:50:09,548 > 00:50:12,592
22 years ago,
I worked as a machine operator

771
00:50:12,676 > 00:50:15,429
in your father's family food plant.

772
00:50:16,596 > 00:50:18,682
But one day things changed.

773
00:50:18,765 > 00:50:20,767
THE GREAT PANTRY

774
00:50:21,727 > 00:50:25,605
I had to stay late and Sergio was there.

775
00:50:26,440 > 00:50:28,984
I heard things were not going well

776
00:50:29,067 > 00:50:31,403
between him and the woman
he had just married.

777
00:50:33,864 > 00:50:35,866
And I wanted to be kind,

778
00:50:37,075 > 00:50:40,287
without ever thinking
it would change the rest of my life.

779
00:50:40,370 > 00:50:41,413
Are you okay?

780
00:50:44,583 > 00:50:46,960
Honestly, no.

781
00:50:50,881 > 00:50:52,758
Have you ever felt alone?

782
00:50:54,342 > 00:50:55,427
Hmm?

783
00:50:57,012 > 00:50:58,221
Many times.

784
00:50:59,139 > 00:51:01,308
And how do you fight the loneliness?

785
00:51:02,309 > 00:51:03,977
When he told me

786
00:51:04,936 > 00:51:08,356
things were rocky with his wife
and I saw him so sad, well...

787
00:51:09,983 > 00:51:11,693
it broke my heart.

788
00:51:13,069 > 00:51:14,654
And I fell for him.

789
00:51:16,740 > 00:51:19,868
We started sneaking around,
so nobody would know.

790
00:51:22,829 > 00:51:25,749
Oh, sweetheart, I was so in love.

791
00:51:25,832 > 00:51:29,252
I was a simp, as you girls say.

792
00:51:31,171 > 00:51:33,924
It was like in the movies.

793
00:51:41,431 > 00:51:42,891
Until I got pregnant.

794
00:51:45,769 > 00:51:47,813
Of course, I was careful.

795
00:51:47,896 > 00:51:50,106
But these things happen all the time.

796
00:51:51,525 > 00:51:53,360
What are we going to do?

797
00:51:54,569 > 00:51:56,321
We have to find a solution.

798
00:51:57,239 > 00:51:59,491
There's nothing to solve.

799
00:52:00,200 > 00:52:03,745
I'm having this baby with or without you.

800
00:52:10,544 > 00:52:11,545
Give me some time.

801
00:52:12,337 > 00:52:13,213
Okay?

802
00:52:14,089 > 00:52:15,841
I'll prepare Virginia

803
00:52:16,758 > 00:52:18,468
and break up with her.

804
00:52:22,264 > 00:52:23,348
Seriously.

805
00:52:25,016 > 00:52:26,017
I don't know.

806
00:52:26,893 > 00:52:28,520
A baby would be incredible.

807
00:52:29,646 > 00:52:31,606
I don't want to miss this chance.

808
00:52:33,400 > 00:52:35,360
And much less, lose you.

809
00:52:42,409 > 00:52:43,994
Everything will be fine, okay?

810
00:52:58,216 > 00:52:59,509
What? Do you like it?

811
00:52:59,593 > 00:53:02,220
When Sergio found out
I was having twins...

812
00:53:02,304 > 00:53:03,221
Let's go.

813
00:53:04,222 > 00:53:05,390
He...

814
00:53:06,391 > 00:53:07,934
became so loving...

815
00:53:09,185 > 00:53:13,273
and he took me to live
in a beautiful place, away from everything

816
00:53:13,356 > 00:53:15,108
so I'd be stressfree.

817
00:53:16,109 > 00:53:17,861
He even hired a private nurse.

818
00:53:17,944 > 00:53:18,778
Follow me.

819
00:53:18,862 > 00:53:22,240
Can you imagine?
I had a nurse just for me.

820
00:53:25,285 > 00:53:28,914
I spent my pregnancy there
and it was a very happy time for me.

821
00:53:30,498 > 00:53:31,625
I felt lucky.

822
00:53:31,708 > 00:53:33,585
SAMACÁ
REGIONAL HOSPITAL

823
00:53:35,378 > 00:53:38,256
And then I went into labor

824
00:53:39,299 > 00:53:41,468
and things got complicated.

825
00:53:41,551 > 00:53:44,387
Harder, come on. Harder.

826
00:53:44,471 > 00:53:47,641
Come on, you can do it. Breathe.

827
00:53:47,724 > 00:53:51,603
You're doing great.
Push hard.

828
00:54:01,321 > 00:54:05,158
The nurse told me
that one of the babies was stillborn.

829
00:54:05,241 > 00:54:07,452
No!

830
00:54:07,535 > 00:54:11,581
And that Sergio took her
so that I wouldn't see her bruised body

831
00:54:11,665 > 00:54:14,084
because she was strangled
by the umbilical cord.

832
00:54:14,167 > 00:54:15,460
She needs you.

833
00:54:16,461 > 00:54:19,339
She told me to focus
on the baby I still had.

834
00:54:19,881 > 00:54:21,675
So that's what I did.

835
00:54:21,758 > 00:54:25,887
That was you. My Romina.

836
00:54:28,556 > 00:54:30,433
Look, I swear...

837
00:54:31,893 > 00:54:34,062
that I didn't know you were alive.

838
00:54:34,145 > 00:54:37,524
I swear that I had no idea. I'm so sorry.

839
00:54:38,149 > 00:54:39,526
I had no idea.

840
00:54:42,028 > 00:54:46,700
Then things with Sergio changed.
He told me...

841
00:54:48,451 > 00:54:51,246
we couldn't be together.

842
00:54:53,623 > 00:54:55,583
That he'd go back to his wife.

843
00:54:59,421 > 00:55:03,133
And he gave me money
for us to disappear from his life.

844
00:55:03,216 > 00:55:05,760
And, sweetheart, the truth is...

845
00:55:06,636 > 00:55:10,890
I took it,
because I was thinking of you, my baby.

846
00:55:14,519 > 00:55:19,357
I couldn't go back to the plant
and we needed somewhere to live

847
00:55:19,441 > 00:55:21,192
and food.
Ma.

848
00:55:21,276 > 00:55:24,612
But it was very little, it wasn't enough.
Ma.

849
00:55:25,697 > 00:55:28,324
You don't have to justify anything.

850
00:55:28,408 > 00:55:30,618
I was so naïve, Romina.

851
00:55:31,661 > 00:55:34,789
I should've looked into
what happened to the other baby

852
00:55:34,873 > 00:55:37,167
that was supposedly stillborn.

853
00:55:37,250 > 00:55:40,336
But I was so broken, sweetheart.
I was so sad,

854
00:55:40,420 > 00:55:44,215
and only had the energy
to focus on the baby I still had.

855
00:55:44,883 > 00:55:46,509
I'm so sorry.

856
00:55:46,593 > 00:55:48,678
I'm so sorry.

857
00:55:52,724 > 00:55:54,017
So...

858
00:55:55,518 > 00:55:57,729
my mom isn't...
No, ma'am.

859
00:55:59,230 > 00:56:01,316
Virginia might have raised you,

860
00:56:02,025 > 00:56:03,985
but I'm your mother.

861
00:56:04,611 > 00:56:06,321
I'm the one who gave birth to you,

862
00:56:06,404 > 00:56:09,365
and carried you in my belly
for nine months.

863
00:56:09,449 > 00:56:12,869
The one who loved you
from the moment I knew you...

864
00:56:13,953 > 00:56:15,455
existed.

865
00:56:18,374 > 00:56:22,545
And Sergio didn't let me raise you
or see you grow up.

866
00:56:23,671 > 00:56:25,131
I mean, I...

867
00:56:25,215 > 00:56:27,717
I don't think my dad could do...

868
00:56:27,801 > 00:56:30,386
So my mom is lying?

869
00:56:30,470 > 00:56:33,264
No, I'm not... I'm not saying that, but...

870
00:56:33,348 > 00:56:37,477
But what? Huh?
Everything is very clear to me.

871
00:56:37,560 > 00:56:42,148
Romina, sweetheart, please.
This is a lot for all of us to take in.

872
00:56:56,955 > 00:57:01,459
I'm so sorry, sweetheart.
But everything is going to be fine.

873
00:57:02,335 > 00:57:04,254
Everything is going to be fine.

874
00:57:08,258 > 00:57:09,425
Look at me.

875
00:57:10,844 > 00:57:12,303
We're together now.

876
00:57:25,775 > 00:57:27,527
Well, that's what we have now.

877
00:57:29,362 > 00:57:30,488
Time.

878
00:57:32,782 > 00:57:35,285
Time to get to know each other
and love each other.

879
00:57:56,306 > 00:57:58,808
We're short.
What happened to Julio Pineda?

880
00:57:58,892 > 00:58:00,185
He hasn't turned up.

881
00:58:00,268 > 00:58:02,562
Doesn't he know
I'll get him if he doesn't pay?

882
00:58:05,565 > 00:58:07,108
What's up? All good?

883
00:58:09,319 > 00:58:10,403
What's up, Benny?

884
00:58:11,112 > 00:58:14,240
They found the snitch
passing info on us to the police.

885
00:58:14,324 > 00:58:17,035
Who is it?
Guess who? Romina Páez.

886
00:58:17,118 > 00:58:19,829
They saw her talking with a cop
named Cristóbal Ruiz.

887
00:58:19,913 > 00:58:21,539
They call him Whiz.

888
00:58:21,623 > 00:58:24,375
We should've cut
that snitch's tongue out, Benny.

889
00:58:24,459 > 00:58:26,503
Should we go scare her? You tell me.

890
00:58:26,586 > 00:58:27,629
No.

891
00:58:32,008 > 00:58:33,593
We have to kill her.

892
01:00:34,047 > 01:00:37,967
