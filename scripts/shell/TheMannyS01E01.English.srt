1
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:12,929
You're going to love
being their nanny. They're angels.

2
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:15,682
My children are so well-behaved.
I love them.

3
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:17,267
Excuse me. Hello?

4
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:20,729
I'm going to be 15 minutes late
to the presentation.

5
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:24,149
Santiago, leave me alone! Santiago!

6
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:26,401
-Santiago, stop!
-What are you doing, Santiago?

7
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:29,362
Mom, she started it.
She put my shoes in the toilet.

8
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:32,115
-That's not true, Mom!
-Santiago!

9
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:34,409
You're grounded, Santiago! Stop!

10
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:41,374
Sorry! That was meant for Sofia!

11
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:46,921
Please, don't go!
Don't take it personally.

12
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:49,466
He just wanted you to try the cake.

13
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,301
I have a meeting in 15 minutes!

14
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:56,890
I'm not going to make it.

15
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:04,355
Sorry, my bad!

16
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:05,648
No.

17
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:08,610
Tell your mom that I quit.

18
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:13,198
No, I'm sorry, Mr. Rizo.
I'll be right there.

19
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,576
I had to run an errand at the bank and…

20
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:20,622
It was a misunderstanding.

21
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:24,918
So, do you have experience
with energetic children?

22
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,046
I swear it's plastic. I swear.

23
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:31,216
Leo!

24
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,720
Mr. Rizo… I won't make it.

25
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:40,308
Did the board members confirm
their attendance at my dad's party?

26
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:41,351
Yeah.

27
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:44,896
What about you?
Are you ready to be the new boss?

28
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:47,023
I just have to finish
the business proposal

29
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:50,151
that I'm going to present to the board,
and get a new nanny.

30
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:51,069
Hey.

31
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:53,196
Oh, Leo.

32
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:54,656
Ready.

33
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:57,534
Get out of the kitchen, please.
I'll see you at the office.

34
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:00,537
Leo, you're going to burn the house down.

35
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:04,874
It was just an experiment, Mom,
and no one wants to live until they're 40.

36
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,418
Many do, but you probably don't.

37
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:10,505
He hasn't eaten his lunch
for the last two weeks,

38
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:11,923
except for the hot dogs.

39
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:15,301
Because they come out of a package
with listed ingredients.

40
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,887
-But you can't read.
-I learned last year.

41
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,265
Reading your text messages.

42
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:21,432
Traitor!

43
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:24,018
I'm going to tell Mom, Dad and everyone!

44
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,563
What am I going to do with these kids?

45
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,816
No, don't even look at me.

46
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:32,152
You know I don't like children.

47
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:36,865
If you make me take care of them,
you'll be missing a nanny and a cook.

48
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,868
Don't worry, Martita. Last time I did,

49
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:42,245
Leo escaped,
you forgot to get Sofia picked up,

50
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:44,831
and she stayed in school until 8:00 p.m.

51
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,085
Must be the nanny that Romina sent.

52
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,422
Please, let her be maternal,
caring, loving…

53
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:55,884
Don't tell her about all the others
who didn't want to work with us.

54
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:57,510
Okay?

55
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,053
Okay.

56
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:01,264
We have to tell her.

57
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:02,765
No.

58
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:11,941
Good morning.

59
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,027
Hi.

60
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:17,197
Oh… I'm glad you're here.

61
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,201
-I need you to take care of the garden--
-No, Romina sent me.

62
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:24,370
Your ex-nanny. I thought
I was going to take care of kids.

63
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,456
Romina said she was sending

64
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:28,333
Gaby, her goddaughter.

65
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:31,419
Godson. I'm Gabriel.

66
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:32,921
Gabriel Padilla.

67
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,006
Nice to meet you.

68
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:04,846
THE MANNY

69
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:08,099
Sorry, to be honest,
I was expecting someone else.

70
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:09,517
A woman?

71
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,019
Yes, and I understand.

72
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:13,438
But believe me,
you have nothing to worry about.

73
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:15,523
I promise I have a lot of experience.

74
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:17,775
I helped raise
most of my nieces and nephews.

75
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:20,278
Besides, there's nothing
a good lasso can't fix.

76
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:21,654
Did you tie up the kids?

77
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:24,073
Only when necessary,

78
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,742
and the well was full of water.

79
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,869
A well. Great idea.

80
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:30,663
Don't even think about it, Marta.
I'm claustrophobic.

81
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:34,334
I won't leave my kids
with someone like you.

82
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:37,712
But you were going to
with the five other nannies who said no.

83
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:39,589
That's not relevant.

84
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:43,217
I can't have a man in my home.
What will my friends say?

85
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:46,429
They already talk about the men you bring.

86
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:48,598
Although you never brought
a cowboy before.

87
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:53,269
Mom, Santiago wants to upload
a pic of me wearing only a bra.

88
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:56,356
How many times have I asked you
to respect the privacy of others?

89
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:59,650
I caught her stuffing her bra.

90
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:03,446
You're the one who needs to grow a pair.

91
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,198
You're a loser
who's never had a girlfriend!

92
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:08,659
Sofia, that's not okay. Who's that girl?

93
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:12,205
Not dating doesn't make you a loser,
it makes you selective.

94
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:15,124
Who are you, and why are you so wise?

95
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,376
Romina's godson.

96
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:19,462
Do you know what else is wise?
Changing your mind.

97
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:23,508
If you post your sister's picture,
the girl you like will think you're rude.

98
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:27,178
Besides, it's not okay to do that,
especially to your sister.

99
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:28,888
DELETE?
CANCEL - ACCEPT

100
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:30,723
Thanks, dude.

101
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:33,434
Hurry up or you'll be late to school.

102
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:35,144
Hey!

103
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:39,607
Are you going to take your sister's bra
to act cool in school?

104
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,692
I swear I didn't know I had it.

105
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,444
Women don't like that.

106
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:46,823
You have to talk to them openly.

107
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,157
Say something from here.

108
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:51,369
Tell her she's the star
that lights up your path.

109
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:55,039
Make her feel special.
Not that you're a womanizer.

110
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:58,459
I'm doing you a favor.
You would have made a fool of yourself.

111
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:02,213
Thanks for helping my son.

112
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:06,092
Truth is, I bribed him
to convince you to hire me.

113
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:08,219
Just a moment. Okay, you can stay.

114
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:09,178
As a trial.

115
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:12,014
Marta, show Gaby
where he's going to sleep.

116
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:17,019
Yes, I'll be right there.
I need all the account info…

117
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,354
Follow me, handsome.

118
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:19,772
Howdy!

119
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:24,485
-If you call me handsome, I'll follow.
-This way.

120
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,490
As soon as possible, please.

121
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:32,952
You look great, cousin. More than before.

122
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:35,746
Don't waste
your phony compliments, cousin.

123
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,332
Dad hasn't decided yet
who's going to be the CEO.

124
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,626
Do I have to remind you that I'm a partner

125
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,587
and I have the same rights you do?

126
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,423
You do, but you work
three times less than I do.

127
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:47,508
Don't get your hopes up, cousin.

128
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:49,510
Let me give you some advice.

129
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:52,763
You should improve your attitude,
or you'll never get married.

130
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:54,223
Oh, my bad!

131
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:58,436
You did marry Joaquín,
but he left you for Mich,

132
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,438
who is almost twice
as young as you, right?

133
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:03,191
It doesn't hurt me at all,
so don't even worry.

134
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:06,569
Actually, why are you here?
It's not payday.

135
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,654
Your dad called me in.

136
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:13,659
There's a complicated matter
that requires a man like me to resolve it.

137
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,369
You're going to unclog the toilet?

138
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:19,332
Close, because
there's lots of shit involved.

139
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:23,169
Shit that a little girl like you
won't clean up, but I can.

140
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:27,798
Otherwise, and I mean this,
your daddy could lose it all.

141
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,091
What do you mean?

142
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,718
It's confidential.

143
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:31,802
See you later.

144
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,266
-Hi, Dad.
-Where are you?

145
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,394
What do you mean?
I told you I was coming to Guadalajara.

146
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,313
You kicked me out, right?

147
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:44,357
What else could I do?

148
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,860
You're my only son, Gabriel.
I trusted you, and you disappointed me.

149
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,613
Yes, that's why I left.
So I can't mess up anymore.

150
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:54,575
You didn't even take your truck.
I don't know what you were thinking.

151
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:57,036
Don Mario, come get this truck!

152
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:59,539
I want to do things differently,
and you won't let me.

153
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,749
How could I?

154
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:04,544
You kept insisting on alternative feeding,

155
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:07,213
the pigs were underweight
and I lost a lot of money.

156
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:10,049
And now, those vulture lenders
want to take my ranch.

157
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:13,970
I asked you to do something,
and you didn't deliver.

158
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,097
I always deliver on my promises.

159
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:19,600
But I never agreed to do things
they way you wanted them.

160
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:22,228
Whatever it was,

161
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:24,021
you fucked me over, Gabriel.

162
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:26,357
I'm hanging up
before my pacemaker gives out.

163
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,567
Sure, okay.

164
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,652
I love you, Dad. Take care.

165
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,737
Yeah, okay.

166
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:43,541
HEY! - EXCLUSIVE

167
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:47,211
JIMENA LEMUS - "WILL SHE BE THE NEW CEO
OF FINANCIERA LEMUS?"

168
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:51,507
I just saw that idiot Rogelio.

169
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:54,218
He said the company is in trouble.

170
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:57,471
I thought we had a great year
with the clients you brought in.

171
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,557
It's so weird, I don't get it.

172
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:03,185
WAITING FOR THE KIDS
TO COME BACK FROM SCHOOL.

173
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,855
Oh, no. I need to find a nanny ASAP.

174
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:06,772
Why?

175
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,608
This is why.

176
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,902
My previous nanny
said she'll send someone,

177
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:14,697
and she sent me her godson. Why not?

178
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,449
Could he take care of me?

179
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:18,993
I doubt this guy can take care of anyone.

180
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:21,537
He used to tie up
his nephews at his ranch.

181
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,707
I bet he couldn't find a job
and Romina wants to stick me with him.

182
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,168
I don't see a problem with it,
on the contrary.

183
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:30,171
He looks great from all angles.

184
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:32,173
Hi, sweetheart.

185
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:33,341
Hi, Dad.

186
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,636
How's my surprise going away party going?

187
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,804
It's ready, but it's not a surprise.

188
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,514
That's my girl!

189
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:42,099
Did you write my speech?

190
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:45,811
Yes, I just need you to tell me

191
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:48,606
who's going to replace you as CEO.

192
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:52,693
That's a surprise.

193
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:56,072
Okay. I saw Rogelio a while ago.

194
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,324
Is there something I don't know?

195
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:00,951
No, he's taking care
of the "Dos Caminos" ranch deal.

196
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:02,453
They owe us a lot of money.

197
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:06,707
The future of this company,
and ours depends on their payment.

198
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,542
Things could get difficult.

199
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:11,379
I get it, but that's my account.
I should take care of it.

200
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:13,381
No, you should work on my speech.

201
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:16,300
-I'll send it over shortly.
-Thank you.

202
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,177
Thanks.

203
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,262
I'm sure he's going to choose you.

204
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:23,015
Oh, no. Sofía just uploaded
a new pic on Instagram.

205
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,225
So what?

206
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:26,644
What do you mean?
I'm not even divorced yet,

207
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:30,356
and the kids are posting pictures
of a man I brought into my home.

208
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:32,441
And what a man!

209
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:35,820
I don't see anything wrong with it.

210
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:41,575
I tried to tell Tania
the "star that lights my path" thing,

211
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,285
but I made a fool of myself.

212
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,995
Tania's the one that ignores him.

213
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:46,580
She's in high school.

214
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:49,500
She's going to Grandpa's party
because her dad works with him.

215
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:50,584
How do you know?

216
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:53,379
She just put it on TikTok,
said she wanted to kill herself.

217
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:55,506
Let's get ready
so you can talk to her then.

218
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:57,508
-No way!
-What?

219
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:59,677
In Tepa, you don't
leave a party without a girl.

220
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,845
Where?

221
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,055
Tepatitlán, Jalisco.

222
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,224
Is that on Maps?

223
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:08,227
Of course, it's on…
That's not relevant right now.

224
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,646
We should get a suit for your brother.

225
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,356
That's going to be difficult.

226
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,192
Santiago never looks good.
He has SpongeBob arms.

227
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:18,821
-At least I don't have pimples.
-Me neither!

228
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:23,242
-Look at your face!
-You two are like fighting roosters.

229
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:26,078
What's wrong with you?
You have to get along.

230
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,789
-Or you'll take us to the well?
-Not at all.

231
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:32,710
But I'll tell you something.
One day, you're going to be old,

232
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:35,379
and you're going to need someone
to push your wheelchair.

233
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,383
Leo! What are you doing?

234
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,510
Putting out a fire!

235
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:44,180
-No! Turn it off!
-Stop it, Leo!

236
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,639
-Wait!
-Leo!

237
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,391
-Your books!
-Shut off!

238
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:51,687
Joaquín, I need you
to take the kids tonight.

239
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,273
Why is there a guy choking our son?

240
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:55,775
This is unbelievable.

241
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:58,944
We're not even divorced yet
and you brought a man home?

242
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:01,030
Gabriel is Romina's godson,

243
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,491
she sent him to help with the kids,
but he's leaving.

244
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:06,494
And anyway,
you're already living with someone else!

245
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:09,538
It will only be for a few days,
until I hire a nanny.

246
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:12,416
I'd love to, you know I love our kids.

247
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,753
But I'm traveling with Mich
because she opened a new gym.

248
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:19,548
Is that the sixth gym you open for Mich?

249
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,717
How many gyms
can she be in at the same time?

250
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,845
Unlike you, who's never set foot in one.

251
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:27,598
Hi, Mich. Bye, Mich.

252
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,851
I don't get why are we here.

253
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:34,480
I don't think Santiago will find
something to wear here.

254
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:37,650
Unless we're looking
for a flower print apron.

255
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:39,276
You might be surprised.

256
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:43,322
I also wanted to come
because I wanted to see someone.

257
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:45,032
Are you ready?

258
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:47,368
Ro-ro-ro-ro-Romina!

259
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:49,620
Kids!

260
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:51,539
-Did you escape from home?
-No!

261
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:54,917
I wish. Mom went crazy since you left.

262
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,294
-Come back, please.
-Oh, sweetie.

263
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:59,004
Or take us with you.

264
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,590
You'll have to manage
because I'm not coming back.

265
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,844
I always dreamt of having a shop
with products from Gabriel's ranch.

266
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:07,638
-Gabriel's?
-You have a ranch?

267
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:11,809
It's my dad's. I rather not talk about it.

268
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:13,477
Why?

269
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:17,815
Because Gabriel isn't
what his dad wished he was.

270
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:18,858
Are you gay?

271
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:21,569
No. And there wouldn't be
anything wrong with that, Leo.

272
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:26,282
-See what you did?
-Don't feel down, son.

273
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:29,159
You're the cutest godson ever.

274
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,998
-We're going to change the world, right?
-That's the goal.

275
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:35,875
I know what that feels like.

276
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,544
My mom hates that I like the color pink.

277
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,838
Did you know
there are 29,000 tones of pink?

278
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:43,215
Maybe both of us
should try something different.

279
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:46,844
Now we need to find something
for Santiago to impress that girl.

280
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,638
Yuck!

281
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,849
What's wrong, Leo? You had never seen one?

282
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:53,851
-That's where hot dogs come from.
-No!

283
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:54,810
-Yes.
-No.

284
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,520
Yes. Excuse me, sir.

285
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:58,230
-Can we take a picture?
-Of course.

286
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,608
-Get ready for a picture.
-Oh, my God.

287
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:03,027
How's it going, son? Everything okay?

288
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:06,030
I don't know.
Jimena said this is a trial period.

289
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:09,074
I don't think I'm going to get the gig.

290
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,911
You have to stay there, Gabriel.

291
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:15,581
In order to save your dad's ranch,
you have to do whatever is needed.

292
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,959
Go all the way.

293
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:24,882
I can't find a nanny anywhere.

294
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,259
Did you ask Joaquín for help?

295
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:31,805
Just don't end up in bed
as it happens every time you meet.

296
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,223
Ha, ha, so funny.

297
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,975
That only happened

298
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:36,769
once.

299
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:38,395
Twice.

300
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:39,688
Three times, max.

301
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:43,275
And no, he can't do it
because he's traveling with Mich.

302
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,444
Relax.

303
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,321
You'll have to trust

304
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:50,658
that the handsome cowboy
will be able to control them.

305
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:53,202
That's the issue,
he's a man, and he's handsome.

306
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,579
I can already see it on Club Social.

307
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,831
"Jimena Lemus brought a man to her home."

308
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:01,418
Yes, he's handsome, but he's feral.

309
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,963
How could he show a dead body to the kids?

310
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,131
I bet he tied them up to put them to bed.

311
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:09,593
I would love it if he tied me up.

312
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:13,722
-Oh, hi, Gaby!
-I'll call you later.

313
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:17,476
Leo is asleep. No, I didn't tie him up.

314
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:22,815
Sorry, Gabriel.
I didn't mean for you to hear that.

315
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:24,316
Which part?

316
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,694
That I'm feral or that I'm handsome?

317
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,989
It's the first time someone calls me that.

318
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,118
That I'm feral.

319
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:44,294
But I wanted to apologize
for the picture with the pig.

320
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:50,009
You gotta understand, Gabriel.

321
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:56,056
Tomorrow's party
is very important to me because

322
00:16:56,140 --> 00:17:00,144
my dad might announce
that I will be the new CEO.

323
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:03,522
CEO? So, you work for a lender?

324
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:05,149
Yes.

325
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:09,737
Wow. That sounds like an important role.

326
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:13,866
My job allows me to help many people.

327
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:16,160
That's my dream.

328
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:19,872
Even if my dad doesn't understand it.

329
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:25,461
I worked hard for things
to be managed in a different way.

330
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:29,006
Yes, I understand that.

331
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:30,466
More than you can imagine.

332
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:34,386
Okay. How can I help?

333
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:39,183
Help with the kids. Help with them.

334
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:43,395
Because, although I want to,
I can't be there for them.

335
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:46,106
Don't worry, I'll take care of them.

336
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,816
That's why you hired me.

337
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,901
Sure.

338
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,530
-And I'm sorry about--
-Don't worry about it.

339
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:57,493
I'm used to hearing that I'm handsome.

340
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:04,583
Good night.

341
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:16,470
Okay, give it to me!

342
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:29,983
I won't impress anyone with this.
Especially Tania.

343
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,944
Don't worry, Santi.

344
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:34,154
You're doing well and learning quickly.

345
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:37,491
You should try to think
that Tania is the lamp,

346
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:39,660
and you're throwing
a lasso of love on her.

347
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,163
I'm pretty sure Tania
is going to run away.

348
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:45,791
Don't underestimate
the power of the lasso.

349
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,878
Try again.
We have to get dressed for the event.

350
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:51,421
-Okay.
-Okay?

351
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:53,966
If you get this one,
I'll teach you the golden lasso.

352
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:56,093
-Two loops…
-One loop, two loops…

353
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,094
There you go.

354
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:01,515
That one was closer.

355
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,853
What's up, Dad?

356
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:09,106
We can't find Arete.
The guys said you took her.

357
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:11,441
Of course, I did.
They were going to kill her.

358
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:14,153
Because she's not fit for breeding!

359
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:16,864
We can't keep animals
that doesn't make a profit.

360
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:19,700
Even less now when those sharks
from the lending company

361
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:22,786
are conspiring with the government!
I'm not going to give up.

362
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:27,124
Dad, be careful. I can come back to help.

363
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,085
No, thank you. I can take care of myself.

364
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,631
Look at you!

365
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:37,050
Are you sure that Tania will notice me?

366
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:40,387
She's gonna stare at you, that's for sure.

367
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,097
Man, you look amazing.

368
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:46,310
Remember, it's important to cause
a second first impression.

369
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:50,063
Besides, there's nothing
a lasso can't fix.

370
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:51,440
You already know.

371
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:55,485
-I think it's true that my arms are long.
-Told you.

372
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:58,989
That's okay.
You can give Tania bigger hugs.

373
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,074
I'll go get Leo.

374
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:12,628
How are you? Nice to see you.
Thanks for coming.

375
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:13,837
Please, come in.

376
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:19,468
-Relax, everything is perfect.
-I know, my dad looks happy.

377
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:29,269
He looks a hundred times better in person.

378
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,363
-Hi.
-Everything looks great.

379
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,950
Hi, I'm Brenda and I'm single.

380
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,369
Nice to meet you, Brenda.

381
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,080
So nice.

382
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:52,793
Why are you dressed like that?

383
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:56,296
I'm trying something new. Less pink.

384
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,215
And I want to create a good impression.

385
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:00,717
I always dress the same.

386
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:04,846
-Kids! Sofi, Santi, Leo.
-Hi.

387
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,182
-Nice to meet you. I'm Gabriel.
-Nice to meet you.

388
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,059
-Ernesto Lemus.
-Nice to meet you.

389
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:11,645
The kids were excited to see you,

390
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:15,607
and to celebrate their mom
as the new CEO of the company.

391
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:19,444
Nice try!
But the announcement will be a surprise.

392
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:22,656
Although I'm happy to see
that Jimena has a suitor

393
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:25,909
who can take her away from work,
so she can take care of her kids.

394
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,703
Dad, Gabriel isn't my boyfriend,

395
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:30,622
and I'm not looking for someone
to take care of me.

396
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:32,291
I love to work.

397
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:35,085
So much, that this year
I took the company to the next level.

398
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:38,005
-And I appreciate that.
-Mr. Ernesto!

399
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:39,548
Sorry, I have to go.

400
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,555
He's probably going to choose Rogelio.

401
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:48,015
Who's Rogelio?

402
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:50,851
My cousin, who wants
to push me aside to impress my dad,

403
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:52,436
and it seems to be working.

404
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:54,646
It was a bad idea to come.

405
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:58,191
I wish I was wearing black
to match this party.

406
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:02,195
Kids, it's not your fault
that my dad doesn't trust me, okay?

407
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:06,366
I have to go greet other people,
and while I'm at it,

408
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,368
throw myself off a ledge.

409
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:16,501
-Tania is here. What do I do?
-What do you mean?

410
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:17,586
Go say hi.

411
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:21,590
Remember, your suit will look better
if you walk proudly,

412
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,258
hold the belt,

413
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:24,843
and then, hat on.

414
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:28,305
There you go.

415
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:34,353
What's up, Tania? How are you doing?

416
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:37,898
I didn't know it was a costume party.
What a dork!

417
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:39,399
How embarrassing.

418
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:43,028
I definitely need a drink.

419
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:46,948
Wait, Tania!
I have something to say about Santi.

420
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:49,576
What? That he's in Christian Nodal's band?

421
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:52,412
No, that he's not like anyone else.

422
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:54,915
He'll never stop surprising you.

423
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:58,585
You're right about that.
I'm going to get a drink.

424
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,009
Thanks for trying to help me.

425
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:09,930
I don't want Leo to push
my wheelchair when I'm old.

426
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:19,815
What's up, Leo?

427
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,110
We can't let Rogelio
take away the role from my mom.

428
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:24,903
She deserves it more than anyone.

429
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:26,613
You should convince your grandpa

430
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:28,907
that your mom
is the best one for the role.

431
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,742
How? He won't listen to us.

432
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:34,496
I don't know. Let's think of something.

433
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,039
Hi, good afternoon.

434
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:44,381
Thank you for being here.

435
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:48,760
This party is especially
important for me because,

436
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:51,805
as many of you know,

437
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:57,185
I'm formally announcing today that
I'm retiring from the company I founded

438
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:03,567
when, one day, I lent my savings
to my brother, may he rest in peace,

439
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,735
so he could buy a bicycle.

440
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:12,159
Today is a special day.

441
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:15,162
I have to leave and trust my successor

442
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:18,373
with this lending company
that has been so important for me.

443
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:22,294
-This--
-Wait, Grandpa! I have something to say.

444
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:27,883
Jimena, my mom,
is the most hardworking woman of all.

445
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,677
And she's also the best mom.

446
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:39,186
That's why Jimena Lemus
deserves to be the new CEO.

447
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:40,270
Howdy!

448
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:46,568
Come down, you spoiled child!

449
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:48,445
My daughter isn't spoiled.

450
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:51,948
Get her down. This is an important event.
Thanks for your support.

451
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:55,619
-Thank you.
-Thank you for that, kids, but…

452
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:59,080
Jimena isn't my successor,

453
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,124
Rogelio is.

454
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:08,423
Santiago!

455
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:14,095
Rogelio, right?
Nice to meet you. Are you okay?

456
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,473
Don't even try to ruin my moment.

457
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:20,852
As you can see,
there's nothing a lasso can't fix. Thanks.

458
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:24,356
Gaby!

459
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:25,815
Leo! No!

460
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,363
Leo! No! Leo!

461
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:33,156
Shut it off! No!

462
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,741
Please, don't go!

463
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:36,868
No, please!

464
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:38,411
No!

465
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:39,704
Uncle, what's going on?

466
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:43,208
Jimena, do something! These are your kids!

467
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:46,878
Santi, Tania is leaving!
It's now or never!

468
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:50,423
Tania, you're the star
that lights up my path!

469
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:53,176
-They're going to--
-They're going to shut it off.

470
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,136
Shut it off!

471
00:25:59,015 --> 00:25:59,849
Sorry.

472
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:07,440
I get that you wanted to help me,
but you can't throw a lasso at people!

473
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:10,569
-And get everyone wet!
-Jime, don't blame them.

474
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:12,821
It wasn't their fault, it was my idea.

475
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:15,365
How could you throw a lasso
at Rogelio? He's a partner.

476
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:17,993
He badmouthed the kids
during the entire party.

477
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:21,121
Stop it! Go to your rooms.
You're so grounded.

478
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:25,625
Not you, Gabriel.
Come back, I want to talk to you.

479
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:29,879
Jime, I don't think it's fair for Rogelio
to steal the opportunity of becoming

480
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:33,717
the CEO of your family's company
only because he's a man.

481
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,927
My dad is will want me
to be the CEO even less

482
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:37,971
now that you got the entire board wet.

483
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:41,766
You're right. That wasn't on the plan.
Leo got carried away.

484
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:46,396
I'm sorry, Gaby,
but this isn't going to work.

485
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:50,775
Can you button up your shirt?
I can't focus.

486
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:54,446
I can't fire you
when your six-pack is staring at me.

487
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,615
You want to fire me?

488
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:00,577
I'm sorry, Gaby, but…

489
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:05,332
I don't think a cowboy
can be my kids' manny.

490
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,168
I need a…

491
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:10,629
A woman, right?

492
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:14,299
My kids need a maternal and loving woman

493
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:15,884
at home to take care of them.

494
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:17,969
I can't do it,

495
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:20,680
as much as I try.

496
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:22,599
At least, not now.

497
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:25,477
How funny.

498
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:28,563
My dad wants me to stay at the ranch
taking care of the pigs,

499
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:31,191
and yours wants you to stay home
taking care of the kids.

500
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:34,319
Yes, I guess it's not that easy
to change the world.

501
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:36,655
At least, not for us.

502
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:38,740
But for the kids, Jime?

503
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,825
It's different for them.

504
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:44,287
That's why I love being a manny.

505
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:46,289
For them.

506
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:49,626
-Are you going to cry?
-No.

507
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:52,462
-No, I'm not judging you.
-No.

508
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:54,839
Men don't cry.

509
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,394
-Can I come in, Santi?
-Yes.

510
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:11,022
Hey,

511
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:14,275
what did she mean
with "you're so grounded"?

512
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,986
I don't know.
You shouldn't have taken the blame!

513
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,572
Why not? We're a team, aren't we?

514
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:25,662
Did it help to dress like a cowboy?

515
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:27,455
No.

516
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,791
She didn't even post a story online.

517
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:32,711
Being ignored is worse than being trolled.

518
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:37,215
Maybe it's because
she's three years older than you.

519
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:42,637
-I can't sleep.
-What's wrong, Leo?

520
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:46,015
There's a Rogelio
with a pig's head in my closet.

521
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:49,060
Oh, my! What if I leave my lasso

522
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:51,563
so you can use it when it shows up again?

523
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:53,648
-Are you leaving?
-Did my mom fire you?

524
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:56,568
No, because she never hired me.

525
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:58,611
Don't you want to stay with us?

526
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:00,447
Of course I do.

527
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:02,824
You kids are awesome.

528
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:07,287
But I have to go back
to Tepa to find another job.

529
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:09,289
Are you going back to your ranch?

530
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:13,376
I don't know, Leo.
I messed up with my dad,

531
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,503
and he's not happy with me.

532
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:18,047
But I promise I will try
to earn his forgiveness,

533
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:19,674
and then I will come back.

534
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,801
And then I can come visit if you want.

535
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:23,636
We're going to miss you a lot.

536
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:25,430
I will miss you too.

537
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:29,934
I'm going to eat you!

538
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:31,978
No, Leo!

539
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:05,094
Jimena, what are you doing here so early?

540
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:08,348
I'm sorry about what happened yesterday,

541
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:10,517
but my kids gave me a big lesson,

542
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,519
and more than my kids,

543
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:14,479
their manny did too.

544
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:15,396
The manny?

545
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,815
I'll explain later.

546
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:20,568
I'm here to say

547
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,862
that I'm sorry I'm not a man.

548
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:27,575
And, I'm sorry that I'm not
who you want me to be

549
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,620
and I'm sorry that I like to work,
and that…

550
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:34,874
Sometimes I want to cry
when I get frustrated, angry

551
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:36,835
or whatever.

552
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:41,965
But being the CEO of this company
has been my dream

553
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:44,217
and you know I'm the best for the role.

554
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,639
I don't think it's fair that you don't
give me the chance because I'm a woman.

555
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,267
It's not that, sweetheart.

556
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,228
I don't want you to end up alone.

557
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:58,690
A woman like you scares men away.

558
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:01,359
I don't need a man by my side, Dad.

559
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:03,111
That's what you think.

560
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:04,696
I'm sure of that.

561
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:06,865
But you know what?

562
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:11,619
You don't have to worry anymore, because…

563
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:13,580
I'm here to quit.

564
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:17,834
I'm going to find other opportunities.

565
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:20,795
I love you, Dad.

566
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:28,386
Jimena.

567
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:37,729
I tried everything
so she would hire me, godmother.

568
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:39,772
I even cried.

569
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:41,107
It didn't work.

570
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:44,861
Gabriel, you can't give up.
Your dad won't forgive you.

571
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:48,781
I know, but I'm going back to Tepa
and I'll figure it out there.

572
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:50,700
I don't know who's behind this,

573
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:53,286
but I won't let them take the ranch.

574
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:55,204
May God bless you.

575
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:00,668
I'll let you know when I arrive.

576
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:11,512
-No!
-Eat it!

577
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:13,848
-You eat it!
-No.

578
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:16,684
-Why are you back so early?
-Mom, are you sick?

579
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:18,311
I quit. I'm unemployed.

580
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:25,693
I told you.

581
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:30,281
I quit, and now you're best friends.

582
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:32,992
Tania said
she had a great time at the party,

583
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:35,620
and she wants to go out on a date.

584
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:37,747
Tania is the girl who ignored him.

585
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,624
I promise I will push your wheelchair.

586
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:41,042
What wheelchair?

587
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:43,169
Marta, did you put strawberries
in my lunch?

588
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:46,339
-Yes.
-What about packaged food?

589
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:48,132
That's not always best for me, mom.

590
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:51,219
-See you later, mom.
-Bye.

591
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:54,097
-Bye.
-Bye.

592
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:58,601
Wow. I hadn't seen them
that happy in a long time.

593
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:02,188
And that's after Gaby took care of them
for a single day!

594
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:07,485
ERNESTO: I DECIDED TO GIVE YOU
A CHANCE TO FIGHT FOR THE ROLE.

595
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:11,823
My dad is considering me
for the role of CEO!

596
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:15,076
What's going on?

597
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:19,247
Come back here immediately,
before your dad regrets it.

598
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,415
What? I don't get it.

599
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:22,959
You're going to compete
for the role with Rogelio.

600
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:26,004
Hurry, your dad wants
to have a meeting with both of you.

601
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:29,841
I can't. I don't have anyone
to leave the kids with.

602
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:33,928
-I need a nanny.
-You had a manny.

603
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:39,058
I hate what I'm going to say,
but I need that man by my side.

604
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:42,979
-Where is he?
-He left to the bus station.

605
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:46,899
You might be able to catch him.
His bus leaves in an hour.

606
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:48,609
Is my dad waiting for me?

607
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,820
I'll take care of that. Go get the manny.

608
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:52,572
What should I say? I just fired him.

609
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:54,449
Whatever is needed.

610
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:57,285
Tell him you got your period
and were hormonal.

611
00:33:57,785 --> 00:34:01,039
Or you could bring him
this crate with rags that he forgot.

612
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:01,998
For example.

613
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:04,000
Anything, Jimena. Hurry up.

614
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:06,794
Yes. Okay, bye.

615
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:08,588
Thank you, Martita!

616
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:14,260
Thanks.

617
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:22,310
Passengers going to Tepatitlán,
please head to lane seven.

618
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:25,396
-The bus to Tepatitlán?
-It's about to leave, the second lane.

619
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,441
Please, I just need to deliver this.
It will just take a second.

620
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:31,444
-Let her in.
-Thank you.

621
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:32,695
Thanks.

622
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:55,885
You forgot this crate and rags.

623
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:59,597
Yes, that's why I got off the bus.
I saw you running with this.

624
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:03,601
My dad is going to give me
a chance to fight for the role.

625
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:09,190
I think we can change the world together.

626
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,111
I need you more than ever, Gabriel.

627
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:15,655
My kids are doing better
since you arrived.

628
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:21,035
So if you want,
you can stay at the house

629
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:22,537
with your crate.

630
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:27,166
Thanks, Jime.
This crate means a lot to me

631
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:28,543
and to Arete.

632
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:35,967
Is it okay if Arete…

633
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:39,095
She would love to stay.

634
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:42,682
Yes.

635
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:46,102
I also want her to stay.

636
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:17,842
Okay, Arete, we have a job now.

637
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:25,224
You burned down my shed.
What's next, assholes?

638
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:27,643
If you don't pay,

639
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,562
we're going to burn down your ranch.

640
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:32,148
Even if you burn down the ranch,
I won't give up!

641
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:34,025
So, let's see how this goes.

642
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:37,862
Do you think Jimena
can handle all of this?

643
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:46,152
