{\an8}MISS ADRENALINE: A TALE OF TWINS

2
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:19,394
{\an8}<i>For Christmas...</i>

3
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:23,440
{\an8}I'd always ask my parents for a sibling.

4
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:27,193
{\an8}Listen, I know that...

5
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:30,071
{\an8}I am a very privileged woman,

6
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,866
{\an8}but I've always felt so alone.

7
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,910
{\an8}What do you mean? And your parents?

8
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:39,372
{\an8}They're really nice, you know?

9
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:41,291
{\an8}I love them very much.

10
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,919
{\an8}But, well...

11
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:48,298
{\an8}they travel a lot.

12
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:52,594
{\an8}Oh, well, your dad seems like a good guy.

13
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:55,638
{\an8}He's also yours.

14
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:58,057
{\an8}Excuse me?

15
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,685
{\an8}No. No, ma'am.

16
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:03,938
{\an8}A dad's someone who raises their kids,
who's there for them.

17
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:06,983
{\an8}Not someone who does that shit
to the mother of his kids.

18
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:11,071
{\an8}Do you want me to tell you
what actually happened, Laura?

19
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:14,616
{\an8}Your dad kidnapped you
and told you lies your whole life.

20
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:18,453
{\an8}And he told my mom that you had died
in the cruelest way possible.

21
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:20,955
{\an8}-And he abandoned me...
-Romina! Enough.

22
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:22,207
{\an8}Enough?

23
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,417
{\an8}-Stop.
-No. I won't stop.

24
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:28,129
Let's go to his house
and see if he lies to our face.

25
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:32,467
Look, Romina,
the time to confront Sergio will come.

26
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:33,468
Don't worry.

27
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:38,556
What's important is that we're together
and we can get to know each other.

28
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:41,559
You know what?

29
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:45,146
I never asked my mom for a sibling.

30
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:49,400
But I always felt like...

31
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:52,904
something was missing.

32
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:00,286
You know what? I completely understand.

33
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:04,124
Because I felt the same.

34
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:07,669
It's like...

35
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:11,381
missing someone I didn't even know.

36
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,886
And now I have you in front of me
and it's...

37
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:22,392
it's like knowing
that's exactly what was missing.

38
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:26,146
It was that.

39
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:27,856
It was that.

40
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,957
No remorse. Break into her house
and shoot her. That's it.

41
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,877
That's it, right? Very easy.

42
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,962
What's wrong with you? Don't be stupid.

43
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:53,756
Who reported us
in front of the journalists?

44
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:55,800
-Romina.
-Romina.

45
00:02:56,301 --> 00:03:00,388
If something happens to that girl,
we'll be the first suspects.

46
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:02,682
And now there are more cops in the area.

47
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:05,393
All the patrols fucked up
a bunch of payments I had.

48
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:07,979
We have to think this through,
we can't fuck it up.

49
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:11,566
This has to look like an accident.
You get me?

50
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:15,320
Another thing, Leo can't find out
what we're going to do.

51
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:17,030
He's a spineless idiot.

52
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:20,533
I don't want him to snitch.
We need to get this girl now.

53
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:21,659
Got it, boss.

54
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:41,679
Laurita, I think it's best we leave.
It's getting late.

55
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:46,100
Rubencho, I think
I'm going to be a little longer.

56
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:48,269
Girl, listen to him.

57
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:52,690
You should leave before it gets dark
because it gets dangerous over here.

58
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,817
Alright, Rubén. Wait for me, I'm coming.

59
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,657
Can you give me
you and your mom's phone number?

60
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:07,205
Thanks.

61
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:11,125
What? Is this how you
say goodbye to your sister?

62
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:12,961
No, ma'am, how silly of you!

63
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,213
Come here.

64
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,847
<i>Oh my God, it can't be.</i>

65
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:28,309
Laurita, right now,
you have to think this through,

66
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,270
analyze what that lady told you.

67
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:33,439
That lady, Rubén, is my real mother.

68
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:36,150
I don't understand.

69
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:39,612
I don't get how my dad
could be capable of something like this.

70
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:43,199
But we don't know for sure
if things happened as they said.

71
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,286
Rubén, he told my real mother
that I was dead!

72
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:50,164
That I was dead, my God!
That I was stillborn, Jesus Christ!

73
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:53,167
And now, the person I thought
was my mom my whole life,

74
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:57,588
I have no idea if she knows,
if she has anything to do with this.

75
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,507
I didn't grow up with my sister.

76
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,927
I have a twin sister
and I didn't grow up with her. Why?

77
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:06,014
To grow up raised by the nannies?

78
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:09,350
By the nannies? Was that it, Rubén?

79
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:13,938
Calm down, please.
You have a lot to process right now.

80
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:18,985
And no matter what, Mr. Sergio is your dad
and Mrs. Virginia raised you.

81
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:22,363
They love you.
You have to consider that a little, right?

82
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:42,592
What, Mom?
Are we not going to talk about it?

83
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,218
Talk about what, Romina?

84
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,847
I told you everything I had to say.
That's that.

85
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:51,893
Well, you can tell me how you feel.

86
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:54,353
How are you with...?

87
00:05:58,232 --> 00:06:00,193
That man's a bastard, Romina!

88
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:03,446
-A bastard, I'm so stupid.
-Mom, enough, enough.

89
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:04,489
Mom, enough.

90
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:06,115
Enough.

91
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:09,494
Look at me, look at me.

92
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:15,833
I want you to know
that none of this is your fault.

93
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:17,668
None of this, Mom.

94
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:19,837
That jerk's the one to blame.

95
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,048
And I promise you

96
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:25,510
that he's gonna pay
for what he did to you.

97
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:27,053
For all he did. I swear.

98
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:37,188
Laurita,
as you can see, you have a visitor.

99
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:41,484
I don't want to see anyone, Rubén.

100
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:45,071
But you have to go in
and act like nothing's wrong,

101
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:49,117
because if they ask questions
and see your face, what will you say?

102
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,077
Nothing.

103
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:54,622
We're not gonna tell anyone, Rubén.

104
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,041
This has to stay between us two,

105
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,544
at least until I talk to my dad.

106
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:01,879
You can count on me, Laurita.

107
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,214
Thanks, Rubén.

108
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:06,259
-Get some rest.
-Mm-hmm.

109
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:30,408
Hello?

110
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:33,536
Listen, I know how to get your dad
to respond in court.

111
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:35,955
How?

112
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:39,542
Get this. If we find the nurse
who cared for my mom,

113
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:43,713
<i>we'll confirm how things happened
and we'll prove everything your dad did.</i>

114
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:47,175
And, in doing so, you can also confirm
that your dad isn't a saint.

115
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:50,428
But I never said that I believed that.

116
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:52,638
Oh, well, make it crystal clear, then.

117
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:56,517
<i>Otherwise it'll be my mom's word
against that kidnapper's.</i>

118
00:07:56,601 --> 00:08:00,229
If he hires a powerful lawyer,
we're screwed. You know that.

119
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,356
Miss Laura,

120
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:06,652
don't forget that Santi and Miss Mariana
are waiting for you.

121
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:07,904
Okay.

122
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,031
-Thanks, Luzma.
-My pleasure.

123
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,409
I have to go.

124
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,962
-Hi, my love.
-Hi, honey.

125
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,770
SERGIO VÉLEZ TALK ABOUT HIS MARRIAGE
FOR THE FIRST TIME

126
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,859
SERGIO VÉLEZ WINS BIG
AT THE ENTREPRENEUR DREAM AWARDS

127
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,711
WANT TO GO OUT? I WANT TO SEE YOU.

128
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,645
Coming!

129
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,275
Hello.

130
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:30,903
I was just about to go look for you, but...

131
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:38,953
How's this?

132
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,395
-Sweetie.
-Yes?

133
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,689
I don't feel good.

134
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,066
-Oh, you were serious?
-Yes.

135
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:12,111
I thought you made it up
to get rid of Mari.

136
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:13,029
Uh-uh.

137
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,030
What's wrong?

138
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,366
I'm tired.

139
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:19,452
Oh, well.

140
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:22,038
-Want to go to sleep?
-Yes.

141
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,043
-Good night.
-Good night.

142
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:41,599
-Water?
-Yes.

143
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:43,267
Oof.

144
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:48,773
I'm not complaining or anything like that,
but I have to ask.

145
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:50,441
What was that?

146
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:54,445
What happened? It was so sudden, so nice.

147
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:55,529
My God.

148
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:02,703
Okay.

149
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,250
What happened to you?

150
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:12,171
Are you okay?

151
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:19,845
Well, no, I'm not exactly okay.

152
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,724
Tell me how I can help.

153
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,018
How can we fix it? Let's do it right now.

154
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,104
Listen, mister, calm down.

155
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,648
You can't solve everything for me.

156
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:31,982
But...

157
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:34,235
I appreciate your concern.

158
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:39,031
I don't like to see you sad or downcast.

159
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,367
Tell me what's going on.

160
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:46,247
Why talk about that now?
Let's not talk about it.

161
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:50,501
Look, I already feel better
just by being here with you. Hmm?

162
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:53,003
I feel better too, with you here with me.

163
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,757
But that means
you're not going to tell me, right?

164
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,510
Trust me.

165
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,264
It's...

166
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:07,518
family problems, that's all.

167
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,103
Alright.

168
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:14,191
Don't tell me you're having problems
with my mother-in-law

169
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:17,778
because if that's the case, sorry,
but I'll have to take her side.

170
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,155
-Oh yeah?
-Yes.

171
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,698
Oh yeah?

172
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:22,825
Oh yeah? You're shameless!

173
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,953
-Alright, alright, alright.
-Oh yeah?

174
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:30,499
I bet it's very difficult,
seeing as her daughter is so much work.

175
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:32,460
Besides,

176
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:37,131
Mrs. Yesenia, so cute,
all calm and easygoing.

177
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:38,841
Don't be so sure.

178
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:42,011
Mrs. Yesenia has a temper too.

179
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,096
Oh, yes, I believe it,

180
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,724
because all of this fire
had to come from somewhere.

181
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:51,729
Or maybe it came from your dad's side.

182
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,857
Because, by the way, you...

183
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:58,277
you've never told me
anything about your dad.

184
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:05,701
Cristóbal, I only have a mom.

185
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,829
Come here, come here, come here.

186
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,372
Look, sorry...

187
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,208
Do you forgive me?

188
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:17,171
I didn't know
it was a sensitive topic for you.

189
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:20,716
I promise I won't mention him again, okay?

190
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:23,969
It's okay.

191
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:28,265
It's okay. I'm not mad at you.

192
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:30,351
-Are you really not mad at me?
-No.

193
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:32,645
Besides, I can't get mad at you.

194
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,188
Why not?

195
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:37,358
Because I love you.

196
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,237
I love you too.

197
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,451
Romi...

198
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:48,369
Hmm?

199
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:52,915
I've never felt
this way about anyone, okay?

200
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:55,501
Me neither.

201
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:57,294
Really?

202
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,938
SONIA MENDIGAÑA IN SAMACÁ

203
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,609
Rubén, um...

204
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,195
Can I ask you a favor?

205
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:11,368
I need you to find the nurse
who took care of Yesenia.

206
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,998
I'll send you the information I have.

207
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,544
Honey, are you okay?

208
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:23,130
Yes! Coming!

209
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:33,641
How are you?

210
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:36,518
Kind of nauseous.

211
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,729
-Oh.
-Mm.

212
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:41,732
-Were you talking on the phone?
-No it was...

213
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:45,778
I was watching a video to distract myself.

214
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:46,695
Okay.

215
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,197
Did I wake you up? Sorry.

216
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,907
-Sorry, sorry.
-No, it's okay.

217
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,368
Want me to look for something
for your tummy?

218
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,203
-No, no.
-A pill?

219
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,996
-Nothing?
-No, let's go to sleep.

220
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,331
-Let's go to sleep.
-Okay.

221
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,583
Come here.

222
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:25,734
You know what, Romina?
I've been thinking that you are so mad,

223
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:29,113
and I understand,
because, obviously, I feel the same way,

224
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:32,282
but I think that we could use this
in a different way.

225
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:37,121
I don't know, transform it,
make it something happy, joyful,

226
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:39,623
because, in the end,
it's now the three of us.

227
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:44,920
Look, I promise that all three of us
will decide what to do together.

228
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:45,963
-Okay.
-Okay?

229
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:47,715
-Promise?
-I promise.

230
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:49,091
-Really?
-Really.

231
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:50,009
Alright.

232
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,593
So change that face, then.

233
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:54,263
Like you said, it's us three now,

234
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:57,141
and Mom, I promise you, that, from now on,

235
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:00,144
only good things will happen for us.
I swear.

236
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,313
God bless you, honey.

237
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:05,649
<i>Listen carefully.</i>

238
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:09,778
We're going to follow that girl
until we know where she goes and when.

239
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:13,532
And when we know that,
you already know what to do.

240
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:17,494
Heads up, Nuche.

241
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,121
We're on alert.

242
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:51,945
We can't follow her.

243
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,617
She went into the second one, hurry!

244
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,452
<i>She's got it figured out.</i>

245
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:00,370
<i>She sells empanadas in the morning.</i>

246
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:03,540
She changes her afternoon routine
according to her clients.

247
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:08,045
It's tough following her
because she goes everywhere on that bike.

248
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:10,964
She goes into little alleys
where cars can't even fit.

249
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:16,470
We won't touch that girl until we know
everything she does in the hood,

250
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:21,141
because we're doing the hit
in our territory.

251
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,310
-Okay?
-Yes.

252
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:40,702
Romi. Romi, wait. Romi, come here!

253
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:44,748
Come here. I was telling the truth.
I'll leave all this shit behind, okay?

254
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:47,000
Leo, I'm not telling you anything.

255
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:51,171
Romi, I know you.
Besides, when I make a promise, I keep it.

256
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:52,256
Leo,

257
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:57,177
honestly, I couldn't care less
about what you do with your life.

258
00:18:57,886 --> 00:19:02,141
But I'll tell you one thing, kid.
Sometimes, blood is thicker than water.

259
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:03,767
Come on, Romi, let's talk.

260
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,811
-Come on.
-Be careful, kid.

261
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:12,359
<i>No, Laurita, it's not good news.</i>

262
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:15,904
<i>No one in this town
knows anyone named Sonia Mendigaña.</i>

263
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:21,034
There is no record of her
working at the hospital.

264
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,202
Unbelievable.

265
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:27,332
<i>Well, hardly, Laurita,
because it's been almost 20 years.</i>

266
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:32,629
It's possible she was only hired
to assist in the birth, you know.

267
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:36,216
<i>She's probably not even from here.</i>

268
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,260
Well, don't worry, Rubén.

269
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:42,181
Just come back
because I don't want my dad to find out

270
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,725
that you left
and tell you off because of me.

271
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:46,560
We'll talk. Thanks, bye.

272
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:50,105
-Good morning, sweetie.
-Hello.

273
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,481
-How are you?
-Good.

274
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:55,068
I love how that sweater looks on you.

275
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:56,862
And the pants.

276
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:58,906
-Good morning, excuse me.
-Good morning.

277
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:01,241
-Hello, Luzma.
-How are you, ma'am?

278
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:02,159
Good.

279
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:05,537
I like your boots too.
I think it's your favorite look.

280
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,414
-Excuse me, enjoy!
-Thanks.

281
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:08,373
Thanks, Luzma.

282
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,293
Yes, you're prettier than ever.

283
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,755
I'm really in love with you.

284
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:17,549
You're the prettiest girl I've ever seen.

285
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:24,598
-I'm being a bit intense, right? Yes.
-No, honey.

286
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:27,517
-No, that's not it. Honey, I'm tired.
-Yes, I feel...

287
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,102
I understand.

288
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:32,272
I feel like I'm suffocating you
a little bit

289
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,859
these days, and I think I should leave.

290
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,694
Don't be like that, Santi.

291
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,947
I think you need time to be alone

292
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:44,076
and I'm feeling the same way,
because it's not good to feel like this.

293
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,454
Besides, I have a meeting in Santa Marta.

294
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:50,749
I wanted you to come
to the beach for a couple of days,

295
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:53,126
but I don't think it's a good idea.

296
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,712
I think a bit of space is a better idea.

297
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:59,091
-So that's that, then.
-You're overexaggerating things.

298
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:01,802
I'm not exaggerating. I'm gonna go.

299
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:04,471
-I'm gonna go.
-Honey, don't go like this.

300
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:07,099
-Bye. It's okay.
-Santi, don't go...

301
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:13,563
I need to break away from my brothers
or Romina won't trust me.

302
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,274
That's gonna be hard.

303
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:17,985
Not just because
your brothers won't let you,

304
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:21,154
but because you and Romi are done.

305
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:23,740
For real. That happened a while back, bro.

306
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:26,493
It hasn't been a while.
She's furious with Marlon.

307
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:27,411
No.

308
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:30,580
Once I tell her everything's set
so we can leave, it'll change.

309
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:33,750
That's when everything's gonna change
for my Romi.

310
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:37,045
That's what I'm working on, Estiven.

311
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,256
What? Working on what?

312
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:43,468
From what I can see, you're still working
day and night with your brothers, right?

313
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,888
Yes, but the commission went up.

314
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,851
But my brothers don't know that yet.

315
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:04,364
A pleasure, sir. We are at your service.

316
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:16,061
I feel horrible
about lying to my boyfriend, Romi.

317
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:18,230
No, girl, I understand.

318
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:20,857
I'm going through the same thing
with my Whiz.

319
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:23,318
Is that his name?

320
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:24,861
<i>No.</i>

321
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:28,281
Can you imagine?
No, his name is Cristóbal Ruiz.

322
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:30,325
But he's great at his job,

323
00:23:30,408 --> 00:23:32,661
<i>so that's what he's known by in the hood.</i>

324
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:35,413
Well, my Santi is also amazing.

325
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:36,706
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>

326
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:39,000
Isn't he one of those pretty boys?

327
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:42,587
Oh, Laura, don't get upset,
I'm just messing with you.

328
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:45,215
<i>I'm sure that guy's as cool as you.</i>

329
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:47,092
Mmm.

330
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:53,515
Either way,
I didn't call about that, Romi.

331
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:57,978
I didn't find out anything
about the nurse.

332
00:23:58,061 --> 00:24:02,482
<i>But relax, I'll look around here at home.</i>

333
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,193
And what are you looking for?

334
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:06,903
Honestly, I have no idea.

335
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:09,990
Anyways, I have to be careful,

336
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:14,703
because if one of the employees finds out
I'm going through my dad's things,

337
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:16,496
they'll go and say something.

338
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:20,167
Oh, no. Really,
I like him more and more every day.

339
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,169
<i>Well, we'll talk later. Bye.</i>

340
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:25,714
Okay.

341
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:29,009
Marriage...

342
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:31,887
From the old man down here.

343
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:38,768
There's money missing.

344
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:42,898
Oh, yes.
He wasn't able to pay all the interest.

345
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:45,567
So what? Do I start crying or what?

346
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:49,237
Come on, bro.
Things are really hard out there.

347
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:53,617
This guy has always paid on time.
I gave him until next week. That's all.

348
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:58,038
No, not until next week. I'm writing here
that the client's your problem.

349
00:24:58,121 --> 00:24:59,122
You take care of it.

350
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:00,248
Come on, Benny.

351
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:03,418
You know I get along better
with people than with all of you

352
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:05,462
who scare them like Marlon does.

353
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:10,300
Oh, what's this? The psychologist.
Is that what they say?

354
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,929
-Not true.
-Like they say out there.

355
00:25:15,513 --> 00:25:19,351
Talking it out is better than war.
Remember that.

356
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:22,103
Hmm? How about you just charge them
what they owe?

357
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:25,190
Quit talking shit. Give me Gloria's.

358
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:27,484
It's here. This is Gloria's.

359
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:30,862
Alright then, Romi.
I haven't found anything strange here.

360
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:35,533
And now I have to clean up this mess.
So annoying.

361
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,494
<i>Bad luck.</i>

362
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:41,373
Come on, then,
let's talk about something else.

363
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:43,166
Are we gonna see each other again?

364
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,834
I'd love to.

365
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:46,628
Besides,

366
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:50,423
there's a bunch of stuff
I want to tell you.

367
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:52,133
<i>But you know what?</i>

368
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:55,053
It's better if we meet up
at a different place.

369
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:59,808
So we don't go calling attention to us
with that Land Rover of yours.

370
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:02,811
I have the perfect place
where we can see each other.

371
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,146
I'll send it to you.

372
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,481
Go ahead.

373
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:20,287
Sir, right here, right here.
Thanks, all good.

374
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:37,095
Rubencho!

375
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:42,183
What's up?

376
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:45,895
-They're waiting for you.
-Great seeing you. Yeah? Oh, good.

377
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:53,111
This place is empty.

378
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:56,239
Laura!

379
00:26:58,158 --> 00:26:58,992
Lau!

380
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:00,493
Romi?

381
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:02,954
-Girl!
-Over here, go on.

382
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:10,420
Wow!

383
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,924
And I present to you...

384
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:16,718
my baby.

385
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,137
My first bakery.

386
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:23,516
The idea is to become independent
from my parents with this place

387
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,728
and, eventually,
be able to live off of this.

388
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:29,981
Laura, this place is amazing.

389
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:33,193
-And it's yours?
-No.

390
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:38,198
I've just paid the down payment,
and we'll go from there.

391
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:39,991
And how'd you do that?

392
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:43,411
Saving up.

393
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:46,289
And working, a lot.

394
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:50,835
I invested every dollar
I've ever made into this place.

395
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:55,590
My wages, my allowances, my bonuses.

396
00:27:55,673 --> 00:27:56,508
Everything.

397
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:59,803
Girl, I've also saved my whole life,

398
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:02,430
but I can't afford
to change the brakes on my bike.

399
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:08,478
Relax, Romi,
we're going to change that together.

400
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:11,856
Oh, listen to this girl. Uh-uh.

401
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,233
No, no ma'am.

402
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:16,194
Okay, crazy, just walk
and I'll show you the kitchen.

403
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:18,154
It's actually finished.

404
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:19,989
-Over here?
-Yes. Go ahead.

405
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:22,867
Let's put on music.

406
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:28,706
Oh...

407
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:33,044
Laura, no, what's with the boring music?

408
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:35,713
No, I'm gonna show you the good stuff.

409
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:40,093
No!

410
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:44,222
No, I can't concentrate with that music.

411
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,225
Okay, so here, we'll make a deal.

412
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:49,185
We each get one.

413
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:53,022
Deal, but I'll start then.

414
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:56,609
Romi.

415
00:28:58,695 --> 00:28:59,529
It's just...

416
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:02,866
I feel like I've known you my whole life.

417
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,035
Well, it's true.

418
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:10,957
Don't you see that you and I
met each other in my mom's belly?

419
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:14,836
Alright, time to bake.

420
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:17,922
Go on, because I'm getting hungry.

421
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:22,010
-What else do we need? Okay...
-I'll help.

422
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:32,896
Mmm!

423
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:38,401
No! No, no, no, Laura.
Oh my God, what is this?

424
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:39,986
I have no words.

425
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:43,198
Oh my God, this is so good.

426
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:44,407
Mmm.

427
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:47,660
Girl, that talent came from my mom.

428
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:48,912
Seriously!

429
00:29:49,412 --> 00:29:52,373
You guys are the exact same,
both of you are amazing chefs!

430
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:53,750
Ha!

431
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:55,668
Good to know.

432
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:57,045
Look.

433
00:29:58,129 --> 00:29:59,672
This is for Yesenia.

434
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:03,510
Ah!

435
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:07,972
I can't promise
this is gonna make it home in one piece.

436
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:12,018
Romi,

437
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:15,480
I want you and Yesenia
to be my guests of honor

438
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:17,607
the day I open the shop.

439
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:20,819
And I hope by that day,
we will have spoken to my dad,

440
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:22,570
and have resolved everything...

441
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:25,990
Well, Lau, that's...

442
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:31,412
It's best if you don't give him a chance
to come and tell you what to do.

443
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:35,917
In other words, if you call him,
don't tell him about this.

444
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:38,670
Yeah?

445
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:40,839
Promise?

446
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,383
I promise.

447
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:58,565
Nuche already confirmed that the girl
is hanging around with that cop.

448
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:02,318
Another snitch we'll have to clean out.
But later,

449
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:04,237
because first, Romina.

450
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:08,867
What's up?

451
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,827
-What's up, bro?
-What's up?

452
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:12,537
What are you up to?

453
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,664
Hard at work, not that you'd know it.

454
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:17,125
What are you working on?

455
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:20,670
On whatever we need
to get this family ahead, right, Benny?

456
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:22,255
Important things.

457
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,215
Family things.

458
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:25,675
See you later.

459
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:27,051
See ya.

460
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:44,944
Well, welcome.

461
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:47,947
Wow, what a beautiful place!

462
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:51,618
Did you make this all yourself?

463
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,745
Let's say I did,

464
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,873
but I've had a lot of help.

465
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:58,875
Oh, don't be modest.

466
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:04,422
How impressive, you're opening a business
all by yourself, and so young!

467
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:06,341
Very brave.

468
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:11,137
What's wrong? Why do you make that face?

469
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:15,475
My dad has never said that.

470
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:19,979
Sometimes it's like...

471
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:24,025
it's like I've never been good enough
for him.

472
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:27,403
Sweetie.

473
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,531
Let me tell you something.

474
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:33,159
You're an amazing woman.

475
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:36,788
And don't ever let anyone
tell you otherwise, okay?

476
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:42,502
And for whatever it's worth,
I'm very proud of you.

477
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:55,181
A few more steps, careful.
There, there, there.

478
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:58,434
Ready? Can I open my eyes?

479
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:00,436
Ready.

480
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:11,656
You don't like it?

481
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:13,700
Romi, this is beautiful.

482
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:17,161
Look, I don't know,
but if I ever leave this place,

483
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:19,247
I'm taking this wall with me.

484
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,290
Oh, don't be so dramatic!

485
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:23,001
Honey, it looks wonderful.

486
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:25,712
You're such an artist, Romi.

487
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:29,257
You haven't seen anything yet.
My Romina is very talented.

488
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:32,051
Oh, I know. Like with the bike.

489
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:36,806
Remember we met
because of that news story.

490
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:38,474
And thank God.

491
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:41,352
Listen, Laura. Thanks for this.

492
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,731
No, thanks to you.

493
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:47,275
Aw!

494
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:53,614
Romina, you definitely
never cease to amaze me.

495
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:56,367
-Laura.
-Hmm?

496
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:58,703
-Can I see the kitchen?
-Of course.

497
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:00,705
-Where is it?
-Over here.

498
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:01,998
Oh, okay, great.

499
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:08,629
I also wanted to tell you
that I gave Rubén the coordinates

500
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:12,800
to a place I want to take you
because I have a surprise for you.

501
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:14,343
What?

502
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:15,928
Another one?

503
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:20,892
But don't say anything to my mom
because she'll get worried.

504
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:23,144
And why would she get worried?

505
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:24,729
It's just...

506
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:27,106
No, no, no. What a kitchen!

507
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,942
My dream kitchen. Did you see it, Romina?

508
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:34,197
-Oh, how's the kitchen? Cool, right?
-This place is beautiful.

509
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,783
-And ready to welcome you.
-Thanks, honey.

510
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:48,419
-Thanks.
-See how happy you look?

511
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:52,298
This is how you should always be,
happy, you know?

512
00:34:53,716 --> 00:34:56,761
Rubén, do you know that there's something
still on my mind?

513
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:58,054
What?

514
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:02,225
That we haven't found out anything
to prove what my dad did.

515
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:03,434
Well...

516
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:07,480
I've been looking,
and I'm going to the hospitals

517
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:09,899
near Samacá to see if I find anything.

518
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:11,776
Thanks, Rubén.

519
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:16,155
You know that if we don't find anything,
we'll have to keep looking.

520
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:18,699
Yes, but for what?

521
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:20,993
I don't know.

522
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:38,529
It won't turn on
and I can't find the charger.

523
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:41,991
Gregorio, my godson, has a computer shop.

524
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:43,242
He can figure it out.

525
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:45,745
-That's a good idea.
-Of course.

526
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:46,662
Alright.

527
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,832
-Thanks.
-Oh, wait!

528
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:54,962
That girl Romina told me
to give this to you

529
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:57,965
and that later I'll take you
to a place she told me about.

530
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:03,638
Okay. Thanks, Rubén.

531
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,643
Wow!

532
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:10,811
That outfit looks great on you, girl.

533
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:13,189
Still, I feel super uncomfortable.

534
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:16,525
Uh-uh. You relax,
I'm going to make you a pro.

535
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:19,195
-Walk.
-Okay.

536
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:42,677
Alright, kid, we'll start with this drop
so you can see what it's like.

537
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:46,681
Romi, I even fall out of bed sometimes.

538
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,600
Oh, but you know how to ride a bike.

539
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,727
Right? Yes!

540
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:54,689
-No, I do know, but...
-If not, you didn't have a childhood.

541
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:57,400
Don't worry about it, kid.

542
00:37:57,483 --> 00:38:01,279
You taught me how to make desserts,
I'll teach you how to be a cycling champ.

543
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:02,571
Check it out.

544
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:28,389
Wild, Romi!

545
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:35,563
Come on, kid, it's your turn now.

546
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:39,734
Me?

547
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:57,710
Oh my God.

548
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:04,216
No, no. Wait, okay.
I'm okay now.

549
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,968
What happened, dear?

550
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:09,930
-What happened? Where are you hurt?
-Oh!

551
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:12,099
-Where?
-Here.

552
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:14,727
Does it hurt a lot?

553
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:16,187
No.

554
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:18,064
No, no, no.

555
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:19,899
Oh, be careful, Rubén.

556
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:21,400
Don't worry.

557
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:24,695
I'm not that fragile, Romina.

558
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:29,367
Oh, no. What will we do
with a pastry chef-cyclist?

559
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:32,244
You'll have to stop her, Rubén.

560
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:37,208
Listen, you're actually hurt.
Look at that face.

561
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,127
It's not that.

562
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:45,883
It's because I just decided
not to go to Paris with Santiago.

563
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:49,678
What? You're going to Paris?

564
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:52,681
-When?
-I <i>was</i> going to Paris.

565
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:55,351
Come on, help me, Rubén.

566
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:03,901
Romina...

567
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:07,446
I don't want to get separated again

568
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:09,657
from you or my mom.

569
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:13,619
I like how you think, kid.

570
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,414
Still, you know that
we'll be together forever.

571
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:18,541
-Whatever happens.
-Together forever.

572
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:38,602
-So your godson works here?
-No, it's his business.

573
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:40,354
-Oh yeah?
-Of course.

574
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:41,272
Wow.

575
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:45,443
This is Gregorio, the go-to man
for computer problems, internet issues,

576
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:46,610
anything like that.

577
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:49,947
-Nice to meet you. Laura.
-A pleasure, Gregorio Restrepo.

578
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:52,825
You can call me Gregor.
Everyone calls me that.

579
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:53,909
Okay.

580
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:56,787
Um...

581
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,080
Can I have my hand back?

582
00:40:58,164 --> 00:40:59,665
Please? Thanks.

583
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:05,963
So, were you able to turn on the tablet?
Did you find anything?

584
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:10,509
Good news: nothing offensive,
no naked photos, nothing like that.

585
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,805
Here is what I found.

586
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:20,853
{\an8}BILL STATEMENTS

587
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,732
{\an8}I don't understand. These are...

588
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:26,275
Deposits. Yes.

589
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:28,903
Deposits that were made
since around the year 2000.

590
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:31,572
Huh?

591
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:36,243
Is there a way of seeing the date
a deposit was made?

592
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:39,288
Yes, look, right here.
It's this whole column.

593
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:42,082
The first one
was made on November 10th, 2001,

594
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:44,001
to a Sonia Mendigaña.

595
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,014
Everything's ready for Romina.

596
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:00,017
You just have to say when.

597
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:03,729
Later this afternoon, bro.

598
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:06,023
Just do it.

599
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:10,903
We'll do it when she drinks her juice
at Gilbert's stand.

600
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:12,780
After practice?

601
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:17,284
That girl doesn't change her routine.
And it's going to cost her her life.

602
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:20,162
-All set.
-Whiskey?

603
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:21,455
Of course.

604
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,291
But pour me a double.

605
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:30,297
-Hey! Hey, kid!
-Oh, "kid"? Yeah right!

606
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:33,133
-Come here, wait!
-"Kid" was when we were together. No!

607
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:36,804
I have to tell you something. My brothers
want to kill you. Listen to me.

608
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:40,558
What?

609
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:44,311
After practice at the juice stand.
I'm serious.

610
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:50,317
We have to do something.
Let's leave and go somewhere safe.

611
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:53,320
If you stick with me,
nothing'll happen to you. Let's go.

612
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:56,240
My mom. No, I have to go get my mom.

613
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:58,492
-Romina!
-I have to go get my mom.

614
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,286
-No, no, we have to leave!
-Leo!

615
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:03,330
If they don't find me,
they're going to kill my mom, right?

616
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:06,166
Okay, alright. So let's go get your mom.

617
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,877
-No, hold on. Hold on.
-Okay, okay. All good.

618
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:11,130
-What do we do?
-Um...

619
00:43:11,213 --> 00:43:13,257
You told me it was after practice, right?

620
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:14,592
-Yes.
-Alright.

621
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:17,803
So we still have a few hours. So...

622
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:21,640
I'll go get my mom by myself.

623
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:23,934
If they see us together,
it'll be a disaster.

624
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:26,729
They'll fuck us both up.
You go on and act normal.

625
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:28,606
No tickets, no problems, nothing.

626
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:32,192
I get my mom, my things, and I'll meet you
outside the neighborhood.

627
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:37,114
Alright. Okay. sounds good, sounds good.
You've got this.

628
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:41,535
Nothing's gonna happen to you, I promise.

629
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:44,371
Not to you nor your mom, baby, I swear.

630
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:47,041
All good. Watch your back. Go on!

631
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:48,542
"Watch your back."

632
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:50,753
"Watch your back."

633
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:52,921
"Watch your back."

634
00:43:54,923 --> 00:43:57,926
My dad paid that woman
for her silence, Rubén.

635
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:00,679
{\an8}Look. This...

636
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:05,351
{\an8}is the proof that this man is everything
Romina and Yesenia believed to be true.

637
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:09,355
Oh!

638
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:14,485
Speak of the devil, look who's calling.

639
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:18,238
Look. Hmm? Right on the dot.

640
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:23,077
Uh-oh.

641
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:30,668
If I talk to him right now,
I'll tell him everything.

642
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:34,546
And I'm not going to give him the chance
to cover things up

643
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:37,132
like he always does, we know how he is.

644
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:38,759
I'm not going to answer.

645
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:46,058
FEDERAL POLICE

646
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:48,060
You stay over here.

647
00:44:48,143 --> 00:44:51,271
I'll get your mom and get protection
after you file the report.

648
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:52,231
-No.
-Yes.

649
00:44:52,314 --> 00:44:55,442
No. I didn't tell you to go and do this.

650
00:44:56,443 --> 00:44:58,570
If I leave and run away,

651
00:44:58,654 --> 00:45:01,907
we lose our one real chance
at catching Marlon.

652
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:04,701
I know you want to be the bait,

653
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:06,537
but that is not going to happen.

654
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:08,372
Yes, it will.

655
00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:11,667
-I don't want anything to happen to you.
-I'm going to be fine.

656
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,547
You know that this is our chance
to finally get rid of those guys.

657
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:19,550
-Do you understand how dangerous this is?
-Of course.

658
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:24,263
We both know that there are times
where you have to risk it all to win big.

659
00:45:24,346 --> 00:45:25,597
And this is one of those.

660
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:29,935
But you know what?

661
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:32,771
I'm very calm.

662
00:45:33,605 --> 00:45:37,651
Because I know the best police sergeant
will be taking care of me.

663
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:40,737
Sergeant Whiz.

664
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:44,283
I truly believe in you.

665
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:45,868
Completely.

666
00:45:47,786 --> 00:45:48,787
Believe in me.

667
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:51,874
Have faith.

668
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:07,598
You have to keep up your usual routine.
That way, they won't suspect a thing.

669
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:09,183
Go to practice

670
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:11,351
and then the juice stand, like always.

671
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:14,146
-Are we clear?
-Clear, Sergeant.

672
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:36,502
Smile for me.

673
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:39,963
Everything's gonna be okay. I promise.

674
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:42,466
I know everything's gonna be okay.

675
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:46,053
-I'll be there to watch over you, okay?
-I know.

676
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:47,804
I know.

677
00:46:57,731 --> 00:46:59,274
Where are we going, huh?

678
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:01,527
With whose money? With whose permission?

679
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:04,196
I'm going to go with Estiven
and his friends. Why?

680
00:47:04,279 --> 00:47:06,865
-Nuche saw you talking with Romina.
-So?

681
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:09,785
Now I have to ask for permission
to talk to someone?

682
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:13,288
-What did you blab about?
-About what? What's going on?

683
00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:15,123
I already told you, you rat!

684
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:19,127
I told you if you betrayed this family,
she'd be the one who pays.

685
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:25,634
Be thankful you're my brother,
otherwise you'd already be dead.

686
00:47:25,717 --> 00:47:27,844
-Relax, Marlon.
-Like Romina's about to be.

687
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:30,222
Marlon, no, no. Leave Romina alone.

688
00:47:30,305 --> 00:47:33,058
Please, Marlon, come on.
Leave Romina alone.

689
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:38,772
She's gonna leave. Don't mess with her.
Come on! Marlon! Marlon!

690
00:47:38,855 --> 00:47:41,191
Leave her alone! Come on, Marlon!

691
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:44,653
-Marlon!
-Quit yelling, stop fucking it up.

692
00:47:44,736 --> 00:47:47,114
-Marlon. Marlon, wait.
-What do you want?

693
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:50,701
Look. If Leo found out
what we were gonna do and he told her,

694
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:51,910
he's fucked it all up.

695
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:54,913
We're not gonna waste any more time.
It's the perfect time.

696
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:56,873
So, what? Is it still on?

697
00:48:01,878 --> 00:48:05,257
It's the best time to catch them
for attempted homicide.

698
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:07,843
Yes, but we are risking a civilian's life.

699
00:48:07,926 --> 00:48:10,220
We'll have multiple officers nearby.

700
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:12,598
I'll be in charge of the operation.

701
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:16,852
I promise I won't let anything bad
happen to Romina Páez.

702
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:20,314
We're talking about
capturing Marlon Chitiva,

703
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:22,649
the head of the Mafia.

704
00:48:24,484 --> 00:48:29,573
Do you know something, Sergeant?
If this goes south, your career is over.

705
00:48:30,198 --> 00:48:33,660
-And the civilian could lose her life.
-That's why it won't go south.

706
00:48:34,202 --> 00:48:35,871
There is no room for error, sir.

707
00:48:37,664 --> 00:48:39,166
I know.

708
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:40,542
I need you all focused.

709
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:43,879
Remember what we talked about
and be ready for anything.

710
00:48:43,962 --> 00:48:45,464
Safety off on the guns, okay?

711
00:48:45,547 --> 00:48:47,758
-Yes, sir, Sergeant!
-Forward!

712
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:13,742
I CAN'T STAY HERE ANY LONGER.
I'M HEADING TO THE JUICE STAND EARLY.

713
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:19,247
ALL GOOD. I'M HERE WITH MY PEOPLE.

714
00:49:30,842 --> 00:49:32,844
RECORD OF SAVINGS ACCOUNT DEPOSIT

715
00:49:36,723 --> 00:49:39,893
I'm really sorry.
This must be very hard for you, right?

716
00:49:39,976 --> 00:49:43,438
Deep down you wanted to believe
your dad had nothing to do with it.

717
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:48,276
But like Romi said,
we can't bury our heads in the sand.

718
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:52,572
And with this, my dad can't deny anything.

719
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:55,283
Thanks so much.

720
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:57,411
Romi will be very happy to see this.

721
00:49:57,494 --> 00:50:00,414
Oh, yes, but she's at practice right now.

722
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:02,541
Do you want to show her later?

723
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:04,418
-I...
-No, honey, don't bother.

724
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:07,254
She turns it off during practice.
She won't answer.

725
00:50:08,588 --> 00:50:09,840
And if we go to the park?

726
00:50:09,923 --> 00:50:11,717
Want to see your sister at practice?

727
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,009
Can I?

728
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:15,178
Yes, I'll take you. She'll feel so proud.

729
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:17,889
-And we'll show her then.
-Yes, of course.

730
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:19,683
-I'll take it.
-Alright.

731
00:50:19,766 --> 00:50:21,184
Let's go, then.

732
00:50:25,647 --> 00:50:28,525
Boss, I just saw Romina
pass by the bridge.

733
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:29,901
<i>She's with her mom.</i>

734
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:33,989
<i>The idiot didn't go to practice.
They're going to Fourth Street.</i>

735
00:50:34,072 --> 00:50:35,157
Okay.

736
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:39,619
-<i>Change of plans.
-Tell me.</i>

737
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:42,414
Tell Carloncho we're heading
to Fourth Street now.

738
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:43,665
What? Hurry up.

739
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:49,212
Hello, Carloncho, what's up?

740
00:50:51,506 --> 00:50:53,133
Marmolejo, copy?

741
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:54,593
<i>Any updates?</i>

742
00:50:55,093 --> 00:50:56,553
Nothing, Sergeant.

743
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:03,268
The practice area is right here.
We're really close.

744
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:10,275
Romina is going to be so happy
when she sees you here.

745
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:13,153
Mom? Thanks.

746
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:42,057
POLICE

747
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:45,644
Station, we need reinforcements.
There's a car accident.

748
00:51:45,727 --> 00:51:49,022
Hey, help me clear the area!
Clear the area!

749
00:51:49,105 --> 00:51:50,482
Clear the area!

750
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:59,407
Valencia, clear the area!

751
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:00,951
Out of the way!

752
00:52:02,744 --> 00:52:05,288
Clear the area,
there may be another explosion!

753
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:07,415
Get out of here, it might explode again!

754
00:52:18,051 --> 00:52:19,010
No.

755
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:21,304
No!

756
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:22,556
No!

757
00:52:29,354 --> 00:52:30,188
No!

758
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:38,738
Everyone back off! Back off, please.
Everyone back off.

759
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:50,959
Romina!

760
00:52:58,884 --> 00:53:02,470
Help! Please!

761
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:13,648
We need to get everyone out.

762
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:16,902
Get back, get back, get back!

763
00:53:16,985 --> 00:53:18,236
Get back!

764
00:53:20,071 --> 00:53:22,324
Get back! Ambulance!

765
00:53:22,407 --> 00:53:24,242
Ortega! Ortega!

766
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:28,955
Station, where's the ambulance
and firefighters?

767
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:36,087
Get everyone out of here!

768
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:37,047
Quickly!

769
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:40,342
Get everyone out of here! Go!

770
00:53:40,425 --> 00:53:42,469
Stop, bro. Where are you going?

771
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:44,387
-Stop! Stop!
-No!

772
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:45,347
No!

773
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:48,058
-No!
-No, bro!

774
00:53:50,936 --> 00:53:54,314
Romina, please. No, love, please.

775
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:57,525
Don't die on me. No, Romina, please.

776
00:53:57,609 --> 00:53:58,985
Please, no.

777
00:53:59,861 --> 00:54:01,404
Breathe, breathe.

778
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:04,199
Breathe, baby, please. Please, no.

779
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:10,664
That's it, breathe, please.
Please breathe, Romina.

780
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:11,873
No!

781
00:54:14,292 --> 00:54:15,460
No!

782
00:54:16,044 --> 00:54:17,337
No!

783
00:54:18,254 --> 00:54:20,757
Romina. Romina, please!

784
00:56:18,416 --> 00:56:22,337
